1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,800
-It's coming!
-Grab onto something!

2
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,010
Yeah!

3
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,638


4
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:15,098


5
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,230


6
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,732
Damn... it's too strong!

7
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,151
We're being pulled!

8
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,069


9
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:29,446


10
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,701
So stubborn...

11
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,369
Tell the bridge
to get it closer!

12
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,871
Bring it until it's 10 meters close!

13
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:39,122


14
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,749
Easier said than done!

15
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,000


16
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,084


17
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,381
Now! Pull!

18
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,717
Takita! Bring the bullets over here!

19
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,260
Yes...!

20
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:53,678
What are you doing?!

21
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,764
Right! Sorry!

22
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,183
It's coming.

23
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,019


24
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,189
Bomb lance, ready!

25
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,273
-Yeah!
-Yes!

26
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,400
Ah...

27
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,486
Here it comes...!

28
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:10,904
Fire!!

29
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,489


30
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:14,532


31
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,377


32
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,382
If it hides behind the clouds again
it's going to be troublesome...

33
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,342
Yeah...

34
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,343
Also...

35
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:36,150
If it goes too wild,
the meat's taste will get worse.

36
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,055
Mika!

37
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,268


38
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,062
He's going on his own again...

39
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,608


40
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:49,859


41
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,697


42
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,324
Mika!

43
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,577


44
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,580
Looks good.

45
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,376


46
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,966
That bastard...

47
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,760
That was quite scary...

48
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,846
-Mika finished it!
-Lower the hook!

49
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,558
If you don't get moving it's gonna sink!

50
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:23,643
Mika! Are you okay?

51
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,647
Come on, Takita, 
don't stay there astonished.

52
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:31,818
This is... dragon hunting...

53
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,611
Mika!

54
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,447
Jumping onto a dragon that still
had some strength left is too reckless!

55
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:40,285
I hate bomb lances.

56
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,578
What?

57
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,457


58
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:54,132
Chasing dragons that swim through the sky,
To the west, east, south and north.

59
00:02:54,799 --> 00:03:00,096
Nowadays, there aren't much left.
Draking vessel on service: Quin Zaza.

60
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,684
Dissecting the dragons they capture,
and selling them during their travels.

61
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,520
They don't have a port to go home to.

62
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:11,399
Catching the wind, seizing the shadows,

63
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,192
their journey goes on.

64
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:20,617
♪〜

65
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:43,283
〜♪

66
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,916
The hoist machine is ready!

67
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,209
We're ready here too.

68
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,168


69
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,259
Stop!

70
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,054


71
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,556
Mmmm...

72
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:07,682
Hm?

73
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,434
It's pretty good.

74
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,519
It doesn't have many wounds too, nice.

75
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,646
This is gonna sell for quite a lot.

76
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,108
Our ship sure is full of holes though...

77
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,610
It was about to fall apart!

78
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,447
Come on, don't get so angry.

79
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,198
Geez...

80
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,493
Honestly, what do they think a ship is?!

81
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,245
Get number 12!

82
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:35,793


83
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:44,260
Please be careful with that 
so it doesn't get any scratch!

84
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,596
This is for large trading auctions.

85
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,555
Retail is over there!

86
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,058
Welcome! How much do you need?

87
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,726
Fill me this with oil.

88
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,810
Sure thing.

89
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:53,978


90
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:57,523
Our oil is extracted from the skin
right after we capture it.

91
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,275
You can use it for cooking too.

92
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,485


93
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,071
-And today's smells especially well!
-Oh my!

94
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,239
How about some meat too?

95
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,616
If you can't eat it all,

96
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,786
you can pickle it in salt or smoke it
and it will last for a while!

97
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,662
Then, I will take some.

98
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,622
Sure!

99
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,165
Very good, very good.

100
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,416


101
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,628
Takita, don't you think you're
better suited for this?

102
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,381
But with just this, I won't be able
to get into the ship, right?

103
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,966
I'm gonna do my best!

104
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,885


105
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,428
Do you have dragon liver?

106
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,013
I heard it works for night blindness.

107
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,598
Of course we do!

108
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,557
Takita.

109
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,725
Yes!

110
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,272


111
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,733
Ah! Mika-san, you can't!

112
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:41,692
Hm?

113
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,319
Skipping out and snitching foo...

114
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,571


115
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,532
I'm not snitching food.

116
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,827
I was just scraping the meet that was
stuck on the bone.

117
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,286
It would be a waste, right?

118
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,579
Chop logic...

119
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:54,956
-Wha?
-Nothing!

120
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:59,460
Anyway, fresh dragon meat
tastes good even raw!

121
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,837
Hey, Takita!

122
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,506
Don't go snithing food when you're just a newbie!

123
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,134
No, it's not it, it's just that Mika-san...!

124
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,553
-Aaah, I'm so so busy...
-Ah!

125
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,264
Miiiikaaa!!

126
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,933
Out of the question.

127
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,352
60% for us. Nothing less.

128
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,729
If you're not satisfied then this deal is off.

129
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,942
There's also a limit to the amount of
booze we can put on board...

130
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,987
That's the only thing I envy from the surface.

131
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,781
To begin with, it's always you 
who's doing whatever you want!

132
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,492
Takita, don't learn anything from him, okay?

133
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,787
What? No roof for us?

134
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,039
Can't believe there isn't a single room avaliable.

135
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,084
Can't the women at least?

136
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,336
Sir, I'm so sorry...

137
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,256
We've been on the ship for a long while.

138
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,259
I wanted the crew to get a good rest...

139
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,345
You see, the townspeople are scared...

140
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,724
You know what they say, when a draking vessel
stops in a town, a dragon will fall on it.

141
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:55,683
How ill omened...

142
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,185
That's just a superstition!

143
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,020
-Jiro.
-It's the opposite.

144
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,647
Draking vessels go around places 
where dragons appear.

145
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,858
Precisely because we take down dragons

146
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,776
We can prevent damage before it happens!

147
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,529
We don't need your pretentious talk!

148
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:12,283
You aren't even registered in the association,
just an unlicensed ship!

149
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,660
We can't trust you all the more!

150
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,078


151
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,956
We aren't really welcome here...

152
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,500
Nothing we can do.

153
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,211
We're strangers no matter where we go.

154
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,670
Vannie-san...

155
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:28,758
We're letting you do business here 
without kicking you out.

156
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,010
Isn't that more than enough?

157
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,303
But we're...!

158
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,554


159
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,097
Understood.

160
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,517
Well, sorry for imposing on you!

161
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,436
We're more than used to living in the ship, 
so don't mind.

162
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,189
We'll get you the necessary supplies.

163
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,857
Sure, thanks a bunch.

164
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:48,694
Once you're done you better get out of here quick.

165
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,155


166
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:55,868
Gibbs...

167
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,828
Don't say anything, Jiro.

168
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:02,833
You can't say we are respectable even as flattery.

169
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,793


170
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,254
You're too earnest.

171
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,342
They'll buy the meat and oil of the dragon we captured

172
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,135
but they won't let us into the town...

173
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,346
I don't get it.

174
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:18,516
It's not reasonable, any of it.

175
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,518
Ah-ah...

176
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:24,313
And here I hoped I could sleep 
sprawled for once...

177
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,148
I want to take a bath too.

178
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,608


179
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,193
Eh, what, Mika-san...

180
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,778
What do you pretend?

181
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,072
I just wondered if you smelled.

182
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,574
Eeh?!

183
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,993
What were you thinking?!

184
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:43,374
Takita, you can sleep anywhere as long
as you have a pillow, am I wrong?

185
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,084
No can do!

186
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,087
We aren't made as sturdy as you are.

187
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,172
A-and then...?

188
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,092
Was I... smelly?

189
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,596
Hm... you smelled like a person.

190
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,389


191
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,974


192
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,311
By the way, what are you doing?

193
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,604
When did you start a fire...

194
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,731
I got hungry after work, you see?

195
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,232
A grill?

196
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:11,110
As long as there's straw and charcoal, 
open fire is good too,

197
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:15,072
but this is pine for the oil mill
and it has a lot of resin.

198
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:18,534
Also, judging from how it tasted raw,

199
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,703
I thought it'd be really good as steak.

200
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,706
Mika-san always looks absent-minded,

201
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,542
but when it comes to food 
he gets really talkative.

202
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,877
Creepy, right?

203
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,130
Slice this rock-hard bread...

204
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,049
Ah... it's hard...

205
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,261
Spread the dragon's fat on the iron plate...

206
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,804


207
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:39,764


208
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,350
Ah! This smell...

209
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,187
When it's done on both sides,
a splash of grappa...

210
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:50,358
Slice the steak and put it between bread...

211
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,567


212
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,402
And it's done!

213
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,989


214
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,533
That's...

215
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,745
That's gotta be delicious...

216
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,038
-Hm?
-Ah!

217
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,873
You're monopolizing it?!

218
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,042
That's big enough to share it with everyone...

219
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,085


220
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,545
Mika! Give me some!

221
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,756
For me too!

222
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,925
If you eat that much now 
you won't be able to eat dinner!

223
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:16,884


224
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,261
I helped you start the fire, give me my share!

225
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,805
-Exactly!
-My share!

226
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,764


227
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,474
Heeeey!

228
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:25,726
Eh?

229
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:29,814
A dragon... a dragon appeared 
above the neighbour town! I just got a call!

230
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,649
There were more aside from that one?

231
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,109
Well, what a bummer...

232
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,318
Please!

233
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,987
Hey! It's your job, isn't it?

234
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,864
Go exterminate it!

235
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,075
Even if you tell us to go now...

236
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,369
We just finished dissecting one,

237
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,413
and we haven't refueled either.

238
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:50,543
You don't need to worry that much, 
they rarely attack people directly.

239
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,711
And it's not like the dragon 
will fall on the town for sure...

240
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,381
My wife and daughter are in that town!

241
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,174
It'll be too late after it happens...

242
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,134
But...

243
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,803
That's why you hunters are for!

244
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,638
You're only saying what's convenient for you!

245
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,597
Let's go.

246
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,101
Mika! We haven't even refueled!

247
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,521
It's just the neighbouring town, right?
We don't need to.

248
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,065
We'll go, capture it, and come back.

249
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:14,900
Like we always do.

250
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,612
If there's a dragon, we have to work.

251
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,281
It's just that.

252
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,657


253
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,287
Well, yeah.

254
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,998
Niko, put out the fire of the oiling pot 
and put on a lid.

255
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,624
Sure thing!

256
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:33,085
Takita! Go tell the bridge 
to get ready for takeoff.

257
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,587
Ah... yes!

258
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,339
Hey! We're turning it on soon!

259
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:38,841
Sure sure!

260
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,426
Upsy...

261
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,511


262
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,180


263
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,764
-Shall we?
-Yes!

264
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,893
Jiro and Vannie go call those who are resting!

265
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,936
Jiro, time to work.

266
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:52,938


267
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:54,899
I know.

268
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,027
Ah, but you know,

269
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:01,697
Thinking that we gotta sleep 
in a small cabin after getting back...

270
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,115
It's not really worth it...

271
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,243
Of... of course we'll prepare a place 
to sleep, a bath,

272
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,829
Food and drink too!

273
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,165
Great!

274
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,375
Once we get everyone, 
we're untying the mooring line!

275
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,793
Leave the cargo on the surface!

276
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,128
Got it!

277
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,087


278
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,719
I wonder how is it this time...

279
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,857
It's exactly above the town of all things!

280
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,944
It's bigger than the one we got this morning!

281
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:45,032


282
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:48,702
Something is off...
the atmosphere feels tense.

283
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:49,745
Gibbs, look.

284
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,248
Look how it's rising its plumes.

285
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,042


286
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,838
It's calling its friends.

287
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,215
Really?

288
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,217
Yeah, probably.

289
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:04,760
I feel it.

290
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,345
Probably...?

291
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,099
When it comes to dragons,
what he says is never wrong.

292
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,058


293
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,685
Are you saying there are more around?

294
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,314
No good, it's not reacting to flash bombs.

295
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,316
It better not be doing it on purpose 
knowing we can't

296
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,110
do anything if it's above the town.

297
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,612
No way...

298
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,406
We gotta hurry up.

299
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,907
If another one shows up we're done for.

300
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:27,908
Wha...

301
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,493
Mika!

302
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:30,786


303
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,124


304
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,751
Hey, Mika!
What are you gonna do if it starts rampaging?!

305
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,503
-I'll think about that when it happens.
-Mika!

306
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,629


307
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:41,589


308
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,257
Wh... What?!

309
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,260
For now... we don't have to worry about
the town anymore.

310
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,219
Eh?

311
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:48,637


312
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,432


313
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,976


314
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,186


315
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:57,938


316
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,773
Get up, hurry.

317
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,860
Now it suddenly got aggresive, huh?

318
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,363
It's as if it was angry with us...

319
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,743


320
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,161
Boss! You okay?

321
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,120
Jiro,

322
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,663
bring as many bomb lances as you find!

323
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:15,623
Okay!

324
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,251
"It looks angry" you say...

325
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,337
It's exactly that.

326
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,546
Eh?

327
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,382
It smells the same as the one 
we took down today.

328
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,675
That means...

329
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,386
Probably, this one's the mother.

330
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,764
It seems it noticed too.

331
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,140


332
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,603
It's angry because we ate her child.

333
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,607
Then, the one it was calling...

334
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,233
What?

335
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,321
No... I know this is being too soft but...

336
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,990
I feel a bit bad for her...

337
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,867
Takita.

338
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,953
Aren't you misunderstanding 
what hunters are?

339
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:58,457
Dragons aren't something
that just wait to be hunted.

340
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,043
People who are not ready to kill,

341
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,252
will die.

342
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,629


343
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,507
-Crocco-san!
-Ah?

344
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,051
The ship's not going to last!

345
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,637
We can't have it rampaging over the town!

346
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,389
Shit!

347
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,515
Boss.

348
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,725
Let's cute the anchor's rope 
and shake it off!

349
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,227
We need to reposition ourselves.

350
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,813
No, we can't be sure 
it won't go back to the town.

351
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,148
If the ship sinks it 
will all be for nothing!

352
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,108
Niko!

353
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,235


354
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:28,904


355
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,156


356
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,450
Mika!

357
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,452
Can't you save me a bit more gently...?

358
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,040
This one'll be hanging on for dear life
until it runs out of strength.

359
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,709
We can't possibly shake it off.

360
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,043
We'll finish it as is!

361
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,879


362
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,548
How many bullets did we shoot?

363
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,675
Doesn't this thing feel any pain?

364
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,843
Dammit!

365
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,053
I don't really feel any reaction.

366
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,513
Takita! Bring me a stun lance.

367
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,348
Y... yes!

368
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,307
Don't.

369
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,601
If you use that, the taste gets worse.

370
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,145
Eh?

371
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,315
If we're gonna bring it down, we gotta do it
as delicious as we can.

372
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,277
You think this is the moment to say that?!

373
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,696
Fine, cover me with a gun!

374
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,448
-I'll go too!
-Ah- hey, Jiro!

375
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,366


376
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,578


377
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,332
Go!

378
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:24,793
Yeah!

379
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,922


380
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,215


381
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,219


382
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,430


383
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,892
You gonna eat me?

384
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,393
Oh no!

385
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,520
Crocco-san!

386
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,148
I don't care what you do, but raise the ship!

387
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,442


388
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,319
Vannie!

389
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:51,653


390
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,074


391
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,575


392
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,327
Mika!!

393
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,495


394
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,871


395
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,414


396
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,957


397
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,751
Mika-san, that!

398
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:06,752


399
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,175


400
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,765


401
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,975


402
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,103


403
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,149


404
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,193


405
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,486
Mika-san!

406
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,531


407
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,075


408
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,743
-Don't let it go, Jiro!
-The hook, quick!

409
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,036
Yes! Ah...

410
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,666
Stun lance...

411
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,502
I ended up using it...

412
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,295


413
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,590


414
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,260
Time to eat.

415
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,015


416
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,017


417
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,394


418
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,021
So good!

419
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,441
When was the last time we ate such a feast?

420
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,068
-One more bottle, please.
-Eh?

421
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,571
Vannie, don't drink too much.

422
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,406
I only have opened 3 bottles.

423
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,491
Eh? When did you...?!

424
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,618
That one's the last, okay?

425
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,871
Ugh, I can't eat more.

426
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,956
This is bliss...

427
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,875
Man, so sloppy.

428
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,251
Wha?


429
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,712


430
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,380
This is so good...

431
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:34,715
These days

432
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,426
we only had salted meat stew to eat...

433
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,677
Right.

434
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:39,761
Well, excuse me.

435
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,180
Ah... No, no!

436
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,891
We're not saying your cooking is bad, 
Yoshi-san!

437
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,350
Here, Mika, since I had the chance.

438
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,310


439
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,187
I borrowed the restaurant's kitchen
and roasted it but...

440
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:52,774
You used a stun lance, right?
I wonder how's the taste.

441
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,195
With dragons, you don't know until you eat it.

442
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,487


443
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,156
How is it?

444
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,369


445
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:05,537


446
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,872


447
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,543

448
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,629


449
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,505
-Good...
-Yeah, you're lying.

450
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:20,510


451
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,809


452
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,355
Takita, you're a newbie,
I don't want to see you yawning!

453
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,149
I can't control a yawn...

454
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:37,236
I'm not a morning person...

455
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,195
And it's so cold...

456
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:41,490
If you're like that,
you're gonna let dragons escape.

457
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,243
Dragons are early to bed early to rise.

458
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,410
Really?

459
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:47,913
Yeah...

460
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,415
probably.

461
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,170
Ever since countries started to aim for the sky
pursuing the rare dragons

462
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,005
it's been about half a century.

463
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:02,594
Nowadays, there aren't much left.
Draking vessel on service: Quin Zaza.

464
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,933
Pursuing their meat, oil and entrails,
and sometimes the bounty they have on them.

465
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:11,478
Chasing the dragons that swim through the sky and air.

466
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,439
They don't have a port to go home to.

467
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,026
Catching the wind, seizing the shadows,

468
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,945
their journey goes on.

469
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:27,160
