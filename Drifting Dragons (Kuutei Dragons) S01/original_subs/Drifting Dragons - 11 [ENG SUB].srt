1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:04,879
Ah... that Takita...

2
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:07,924
I can't believe she fell off the ship...

3
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:11,386
Yeah... if we had been more careful...

4
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,721
It's no one's fault.

5
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:15,265
But even if you say that...

6
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:20,437
Ah... to think this is the
last image we'd have of her...

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,732
And here I was throwing my pants
and whatnot at her every day...

8
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,151
Forgive me, Takita!

9
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,278
All things considered,
she was a good girl...

10
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:29,320
Yeah...

11
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:33,324
In three or so years she'd have
shined as a draker...

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,452
Ahh!! Come on, you guys!

13
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,537
Stop being so ominous, would you?!

14
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,830
But, you know...

15
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,499
Guys... even if they're wounded, 

16
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:44,794
dragons not always fall head first.

17
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,213
So if she was clinging on to it 
until the end...

18
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,382
Maybe... she's safe.

19
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,594
You can say whatever you want, but...

20
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,012
We barely can't even see anymore...

21
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,890
How are we even going to search for her...

22
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:00,351
Ah, Yoshi-san, make me 
some salo sandwiches.

23
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,312
Also, very sweet tea.

24
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,646
-Eh?
-What?

25
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,857
I'll be on guard without sleeping tonight.

26
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:06,816


27
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,652
I just can't imagine it.

28
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,405
Her being turned to mincemeat, I mean.

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,950
So she's alive.

30
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,079
Probably...

31
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,582


32
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:27,879
We... didn't manage to catch 
that dragon, damn it.

33
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:34,594
♪〜

34
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:57,176
〜♪

35
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,558


36
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,186


37
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,356
You gotta thank this little guy.

38
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,943
It's been protecting you all this time.

39
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,613
It might think you're its mother
or something.

40
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:17,739


41
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:21,117
I guess that injury on your leg 
got infected.

42
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,622
If I didn't happen to pass by
this deep chasm,

43
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,165
you'd have died in the gutter.


44
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,876
Ah, what happened to the dissection?

45
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,254
I took out the entrails and have it
submerged over there.

46
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,341
You sure have luck on your side, though.

47
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,970
Luck's always been about the only
thing I had going for me.

48
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,514
Um, what is this...?

49
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,392
I always make it with deer or boar, 

50
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,033
"Salted cabbage and dragon brain hunter stew
with roasted bone marrow"

51
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,478
but with dragon it's the first time...

52
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,023
I hope you don't mind I used
some of your dragon's head.

53
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,525
It's a stew made by matagi hunters.

54
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:55,902


55
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,863
Mm, what a nice smell!

56
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,449
This is my favourite dish!

57
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,742
Let's see...

58
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,995
How does a dragon's brain taste?

59
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:06,996


60
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,289


61
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,920
I don't think I'm hungry...

62
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,047
But you have to eat!

63
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,341
You're pretty weakened, you know?

64
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:22,428
If you don't eat while you have some
strength left, you won't be able to
stomach anything later on.

65
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:24,722


66
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,100
It's because it's this little one's mother?

67
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,518


68
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,563


69
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,902


70
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,863
So good!

71
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,367
It's sticky but smooth.

72
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:47,412
What an intense flavour!

73
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:51,124
Ahhh! I can feel the nourishment
permeating in every single of my organs!

74
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,001
Are you doing it on purpose?

75
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,836
Yes I am.

76
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,046
So mean...

77
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,466
I'm just honest.

78
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,593


79
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,138


80
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,809


81
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,561


82
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,524


83
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,067


84
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,616


85
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,041


86
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,334


87
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,544


88
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,513


89
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,558


90
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,517


91
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,772


92
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,860


93
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,155
Why are you crying?

94
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,698


95
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,702
Because... it's so good...

96
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,372


97
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,209
Yeah...

98
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,836
It's super delicious.

99
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,464
We gotta thank its mother, right?

100
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,050


101
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,594


102
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,556
Mom!!

103
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,226


104
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,604
You have to eat the preys you hunt.

105
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:40,358
You know, the more you eat
the better you live!

106
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,901


107
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,986


108
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,281
There's someone similar to you

109
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,325
in my ship.

110
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,035
He's a man, though.

111
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,204
Hm? Really?

112
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,123
Do you want seconds?

113
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,627
Yes, please!

114
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,590
Wow, a camp in a place like this...

115
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,467
We, the matagi,

116
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,178
hunt with this area as a base
during this season.

117
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,598
Hm? My, how rare.

118
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,934
Do we have a guest?

119
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:16,561
Hey!

120
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:20,022
Oh, and a little one as well.

121
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,607


122
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:24,026


123
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,611


124
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,449
I bet everyone is worried...

125
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:34,078
Or they think I'm already dead

126
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,955
and left already...

127
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,125


128
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,460
What?

129
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,211


130
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,130
The ointment?

131
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:46,757


132
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,468


133
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:51,937
Yep.

134
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,765
I'm definitely gonna bring you 
back to your pod.

135
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:55,808


136
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:57,768
In that case

137
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:01,105
You need to be in perfect health first.

138
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,064


139
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,900


140
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:08,529
Hmm... it's quite swollen...

141
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,114
I did all I could, but...

142
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,324


143
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,659
Eh? Huh? Ascella-san?

144
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:14,911
Wh-what is this?

145
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,040
Takita, bite this leaf and endure it
for a bit, okay?

146
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:20,875
Don't worry!

147
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,544
Granny is an expert with the needle.

148
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,714


149
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,549


150
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,386


151
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,639


152
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,725
Takita, look at this landscape.

153
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,394


154
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,940
It's... kind of amazing.

155
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,859
It lets out some smoke every few years.

156
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,611
Mount Kin...

157
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:53,032
It's said that when that mountain
lets out smoke, dragons will pass by.

158
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,325
Dragons...

159
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,536
Does the smoke call the dragons?

160
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,539
Who knows, it's just a superstition 
after all.

161
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,123
It's not.

162
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:05,753
Fishes swim in the sea,
beasts walk on the mountains,

163
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:10,091
dragons fly in the sky,
and people live on the land.

164
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,636
According to the legend,
our ancestors

165
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,430
arrived to this valley chasing dragons.

166
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,390
I see...

167
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,308
Chased out of their lands,

168
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,728
our ancestors, who were travelling
searching for a new world,

169
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:27,817
saw a dragon fall from the sky
and followed its trail.

170
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,695
And they arrived to this valley.

171
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,739
They thought it was some kind of good omen,

172
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,867
and decided to live here.

173
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,121
Yep, and that's done.

174
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,291
-Rest for a while, okay?
-Yes, yes.

175
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:46,877
Ah... thank you very much.

176
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,048


177
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,969
It looks kinda down, doesn't it?

178
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,765
It's hungry too...

179
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,725
I think...

180
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,577
Wheat porridge.

181
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,429
Yoghurt.

182
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,523
Bean paste.

183
00:10:08,356 --> 00:10:09,900
Nothing works.

184
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,278
It seems it doesn't like any of these.

185
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,238
Hmmm...

186
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,782
Ah, I know.

187
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,369
It's a creature from the sky,
so maybe it eats things from the sky?

188
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:24,040
Hm? Things from the sky?

189
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,000
Ah!

190
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:30,504
Some time ago, a small dragon
happened to get into the ship.

191
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,215
It was drawn in by the smell 
of dragon oil...

192
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:39,680
Insert the blade between the red meat 
and the fat and cut it away along with the skin.

193
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,560
When you've cut it in pieces,

194
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:48,689
Leave a bit of skin and add 
some thin cuts.

195
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,400
It looks... kind of like a book.

196
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,360


197
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,488
Actually, this is called 
"making into a book".

198
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:59,575
While it boils, scoop out
the oil that floats

199
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,371
and after it's extracted,
add the oil cake as fuel...

200
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,873
Ah, some people eat it too.

201
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,583


202
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,710
And that's dragon oil done!

203
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,629
You got quite a lot.

204
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,547
You can use it both for cooking 
and as lamp oil.

205
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,716
Ohh, nice.

206
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,119
Come here.

207
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,930
Look, it's dragon oil.

208
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,306
Eat it.

209
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,101
Please, do it... okay?

210
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,269


211
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:28,854


212
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,483
You have to eat!

213
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,443


214
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,530


215
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:38,823


216
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,533


217
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,661
Why...?

218
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,746
I can't bear looking at this.

219
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:48,749


220
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:50,576
Granny?

221
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,170
How about we add an egg?

222
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,297
Eh, an egg?

223
00:11:56,424 --> 00:12:00,803
When she was feeling down,
I used to make it for her like this too.

224
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,012
I see.

225
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,181
Wha- that was a long time ago.

226
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,059
Takita, pour the oil slowly.

227
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,478
Little by little, like a thread.

228
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,438
Okay.

229
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,151
Ah, I'll do it.

230
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:19,697
All that's left is to continue mixing it
while you add the oil, she says.

231
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,283
Ah, it's thickening!

232
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:23,168
"Mayonnaise with dragon oil and whole egg"

233
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,702
Good, good.

234
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,830
Here...

235
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,087
It ate it...!

236
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,422


237
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,048
It's eating, it's eating!

238
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,800
Thank you so much!

239
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,261
Hold the little thing and give it to it.

240
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,810


241
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,479


242
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,815
She looks like a real mom!

243
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,528


244
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,949
I wonder what are Mika-san
and the others doing right now...

245
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,495
What... are they eating...

246
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,206


247
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,334


248
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,836


249
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,379


250
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,965
Why... what?

251
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,051
Mm... what's wrong?

252
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,302
The little one!

253
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,180
Ah... it's all wrinkly!

254
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,140
It ate properly and all...

255
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,141


256
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:36,273
Fish in the sea...
beasts in the mountain...

257
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,274


258
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,526
Dragons in the sky...

259
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:43,447
This one... probably can't live on land.

260
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,866


261
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,451
The wind...

262
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,247
The mountain is letting out
a lot of smoke...

263
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,337
When the smoke blows, 
dragons will pass by...

264
00:13:58,754 --> 00:13:59,713
Takita?

265
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,133
Ascella-san, I'm going!

266
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,678
Wait... you're going 
to the mountain now?

267
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,681
No, you can't with that leg!
It's absurd!

268
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:09,890
At least wait till the sun goes up...

269
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,308
If I wait, it'll be too late.

270
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:16,230
It has never seen other dragons like
itself nor flown in the sky.

271
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,691
If I abandon it here...

272
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,861
I... have the feeling I won't be able
to go back to being a draker.

273
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:23,988


274
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:27,283
No, I'm the one who saved you.

275
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,577
If you're gonna let that go to waste
I won't forgive you!

276
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,419
I'm gonna prepare, so wait a bit!

277
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,547
Thank you so much for everything.

278
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,259
Ugh! It hurts...

279
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,430
See, what did I tell you? 
Want me to go slower?

280
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,015
No, I'll manage!

281
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,141


282
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,018
That mountain is very steep.

283
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,604
Even matagi hunters don't go
there often... damn it.

284
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,982
Boy, if I ain't kind to a fault!

285
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,235


286
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,240


287
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,702
Takita, want to rest for a while?

288
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:16,457
I-I'm fine... this pain isn't even
the worst I've had...

289
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:17,958


290
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,044


291
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,713


292
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,758
A shadow?

293
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,843
You sure you didn't mistake it?

294
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,219
Yes.

295
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,222
It quickly hid behind the clouds,

296
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,935
but it was definitely that dragon pod.

297
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,978
Or it should be...

298
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:40,314
"Should", huh?

299
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,401
Takita, it gets way too dangerous 
after this.

300
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:45,694
Haven't you done enough?

301
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:46,946
I haven't!

302
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,949
I need to go...

303
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,661


304
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,538
As far as I can...

305
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,293
As high as I can...

306
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,963
As closer as possible!

307
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,298


308
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,885
But, girl...

309
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,179
I wonder what makes you go that far.

310
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,555


311
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,140
I'm the same as you, Ascella-san.

312
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,100
Huh?

313
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,686
I'm just honest.

314
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:20,938
Don't lump me with you!

315
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,899
You're so honest you need to add
"stupidly" before it.

316
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,359
Ehh?!

317
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,195
This is the point where Takita fell.

318
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,906
During the search, we detected
the dragon pod again.

319
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:35,160
We started pursuing it and 
lost sight of it here.

320
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:36,996
Like Gaga said,

321
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,207
that pod is on their way to 
a certain place.

322
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,419
That "ferry" definitely has a destination.

323
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,546
I agree with that, but

324
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,631
thinking that this final destination

325
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,174
is where Takita-san will be

326
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,260
isn't a bit too optimistic?

327
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,387
No, there's the possibility

328
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,265
that the dragon that fell with her
continued flying chasing the pod.

329
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,308
We don't have any other clue anyway.

330
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,309
Yeah.

331
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,771
If we know their destination,
we can also follow the way back.

332
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,773
We can narrow down the search scope
quite a lot.

333
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:08,318
Ah... we have half a day left.

334
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,155
Let's go with this, it's our only bet.

335
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,369


336
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,954


337
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,248
I'll take your place.

338
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,125
You have barely slept, right?

339
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,002
And you're the same.

340
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,172


341
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,882
The horizon is lighting up...

342
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,345
Go back to your room and sleep.

343
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,643
When I was in front of her...

344
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,854
I was surprisingly talkative.

345
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,149
I wonder why.

346
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,651
How would I know?

347
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,489
Find her, and discover it yourself.

348
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,076
Yeah.

349
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:01,205
Hmm... even if we call it destination,

350
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,208
who knows where on earth are 
the dragons heading to.

351
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,126
And with this field of vision,

352
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,545
if we don't narrow down
the area even more, we can't...

353
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,505


354
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,799
Is there anything bothering you?

355
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,426
No, it's just...

356
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,511
Excuse me...

357
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,930
Do you have a moment?

358
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:22,059
It seems there's a legend about dragons
in the stories of the matagi of this area...

359
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,978
Look, this is probably...

360
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,356
talking about the "ferry",
or so I thought...

361
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,274


362
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,193
Is that trustworthy?

363
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,903
No, but...

364
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,322


365
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,449
I see.

366
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,409
Maybe we should believe in it.

367
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,538
We'll find Takita, won't we?

368
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,290


369
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,793


370
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,261


371
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,764
I'll go first.

372
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,308


373
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,479
Takita, don't look down!

374
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,984


375
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:12,985


376
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,988


377
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,658


378
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,660


379
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,203
For the love of...!

380
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,288


381
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,958


382
00:19:29,617 --> 00:19:30,043
Taki...!

383
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,086


384
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:32,421


385
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,218


386
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:39,928
You...

387
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,722


388
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,474
That's bad for my heart...

389
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,811


390
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:48,937


391
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,522


392
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:51,815


393
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,609


394
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:55,694
Thank you.

395
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,489


396
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,742
Ah, the wind...

397
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,996
The pod... is changing its shape...

398
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,207
Is it going somewhere?!

399
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,625


400
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,213
You see it, right?

401
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,465
Those are your friends.

402
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,466


403
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,884
I'll give this to you.

404
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,595
I'm sure it'll protect you.

405
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,769
Ride the wind and go back to the sky!

406
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,354


407
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,313
You need to go!

408
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,564
Quick!

409
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,652
If you don't hurry up,
they'll leave you behind, go!!


410
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,694


411
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,155


412
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:44,243
Don't come back, I tell you!

413
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,870


414
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,538
You're...

415
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,500
a dragon!!

416
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,294


417
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:55,837


418
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:56,797


419
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,427


420
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,814


421
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,945
Quin... Zaza...

422
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:27,035
