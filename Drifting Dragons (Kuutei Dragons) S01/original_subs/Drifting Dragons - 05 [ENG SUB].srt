1
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,382
What a nice wind...

2
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,384
Yeah...

3
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:12,762


4
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:17,934
Damn it... Nice days like this 
make you wish you didn't have to work...

5
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:18,977


6
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,814
Come on, what are you saying, 
deputy captain?

7
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:26,192
If you're like that who's gonna
set an example here?


8
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,360


9
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:31,740
Say, Gibbs, how long it's been
since you came to this ship?

10
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,451
Eh? Let's see...

11
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,411
About 8 years.

12
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,538
That's a lot.

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,125
I guess this lifestyle was perfect for you.

14
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:45,170
Seems so.

15
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,588


16
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,301
For me, it's been 3 years 
since I became deputy captain.

17
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,304
Why don't you just call it captain
at this point?

18
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,889
It's "deputy" for a reason.

19
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,600
I can't just simply drop it.

20
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,187


21
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,397


22
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,649
Capella, how's things?

23
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,568
Very good!

24
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,487
The clouds are calm too.

25
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:11,696
Since we have a tailwind,

26
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:15,533
we might arrive to Quon town 
in 3 days if it continues like this.

27
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:16,743


28
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,536
Yeah, I'm leaving it to you.

29
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,247
We'll finally be able to refuel!

30
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,540


31
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,085
These days have been pretty rough
for the ship after all,

32
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,253
she's run-down.

33
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:30,590
We gotta fix her up everywhere, right?

34
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,884
Quon is a big town,

35
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,011
so take the chance to relax
as much as you want.

36
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,679
Yay!

37
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:40,183
My shoulders have been so stiff lately...!

38
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,477
I'll find a good massage shop.

39
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,437
Ah, Crocco-san do you know any?

40
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,731
Wha? How would I know.

41
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,857


42
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,735
I can't believe what I've been
listening you say!


43
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,237
-Huh?
-Since the latest departure

44
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,405
we haven't captured almost any dragon!

45
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,241
We did catch a few though?

46
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,826
We're a large crew here.

47
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,329
With just that we're so deep in the red
it's almost purple!

48
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,831
Refueling and reparations

49
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,166
are not cheap in the slightest, you know?

50
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,837
Do you understand what I mean, right,
deputy captain?

51
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:09,921


52
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,091
I guess...

53
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,717


54
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,469
Here!

55
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:17,428
Oof...

56
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,305
There...

57
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,015
Yoshi-san...

58
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,309
Do we have to peel all these today?

59
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,269


60
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,563
These are sprouting already!

61
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,023
We gotta take them all out, right...

62
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:33,236
In order to maintain a draking vessel,
we need a huge amount of money.

63
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:39,325
Dragons are sold for a large sum,
so as long as we capture them
we can cover the costs...

64
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,120
But when we don't...

65
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,874
We are the ones who have to starve...

66
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,208


67
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,377


68
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,213


69
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,172
Ah! Hey!

70
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,841


71
00:02:58,636 --> 00:02:59,888


72
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:06,561
♪〜

73
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:29,269
〜♪

74
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,146


75
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,900
I'm... so tired of potatoes...

76
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:39,112
And food's about the only thing
to look forward too...

77
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:44,659
I do wish I could prepare you 
something else, really...

78
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:48,579
I won't allow it. The problem is that
you always are wasting money.

79
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,248
But we do have dragons that we captured!

80
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,916
Those are for sale.

81
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,793
No one will notice if we take a bit...

82
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,255
Oh, okay, shall I deduct it 
from your salary then?

83
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,923
Ah... I'm sorry.

84
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,926
We'll arrive to a big town soon, won't we?

85
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,053
We just need to be a little patient!

86
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,430
Takita...

87
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,765
I'm sick of this...

88
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:11,269
Meat... let me eat dragon meat...

89
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,147
Don't be selfish.

90
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,774
Here, eat some more!

91
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:17,942


92
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,485
Damn...

93
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:23,031
I'm gonna sleep the next 3 days off.

94
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,074
Please do your work!

95
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,492
You...

96
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:27,785
What is it?

97
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:29,912
Nothing...

98
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,332

99
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,708
Well, nothing we can do!

100
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,002
When we finish the delivery,
we'll have some time off.

101
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,380
Yeah! I can get as many hangovers
as I want!


102
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,216
I want to sleep in a big bed!

103
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,509
Yeah!

104
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,804
No more sweaty beds for a while!

105
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:50,099
And... Right, Jiro...

106
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,727
You're looking forward to it too, huh?

107
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,270
Huh? What?

108
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,481
Don't play dumb.

109
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,900
If you're to become a full-fledged 
man of the crew...

110
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,194
You need to know what a woman is...

111
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,153
Eh?!

112
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,363


113
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,616


114
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,370
Can't you talk about that when
there's no girls around...?

115
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,206
-Jiro-san!
-Stop already!

116
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,999
I don't even need to say that
you're paying yourselves.

117
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,294
Jiro!

118
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,588
Stupid, stupid... stupid!

119
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,633
Before we arrive to the town...

120
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,094
It would be great if we managed
to catch another one...

121
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,470
You're right.

122
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:28,763
Hm?

123
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,556
What's wrong?

124
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,557
Look at that!

125
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,184
Look, that flag signal...

126
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,354
An SOS!

127
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,313


128
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,316
Ah... guys, do you hear me?

129
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,276
What's the matter, Vadakin?

130
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:46,572
Sorry to interrupt while you're eating
but it's an emergency, look behind the ship.

131
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,532


132
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,202


133
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,247
Oh dear...

134
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,374
Bring the ship closer immediately!

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,919
Of all things...

136
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,504
I'll approach it.

137
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,475
It's an ocean cargo ship.

138
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,686
Going down!

139
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,113
I wonder if it's a shipwreck...?

140
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,783
If it is, I hope they're alive...

141
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,289
There we go.

142
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,292
Looks like a pretty old ship.

143
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,544
Doesn't feel like there's anyone.

144
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,796
Maybe we were too late...

145
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,633
Great! Then let's split up 
and investigate!

146
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:48,676
Sounds good.

147
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,262
Then, Vannie and me will go inside...

148
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,847
Hey, I'm raising them!

149
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,348
Eh? Ah...

150
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,601
-I'll go down to check.
-Yes.

151
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,519
Faye and Soraya go check the crew room.

152
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,479
-Yes ma'am!
-Eh?

153
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,606
Ehhh?!

154
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,441


155
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,651
C'mon, Soraya, let's go.

156
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,457
As empty as an abandoned shell.

157
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,459
Let's look all the way to the back.

158
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,543
What?

159
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,003

160
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,713
I'm so hungry...

161
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,134
I even said I wouldn't work anymore...

162
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,636
What are you talking about?

163
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,015
There's no one here.

164
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:40,144
If there are no bodies,
does that mean someone rescued them already?

165
00:08:40,569 --> 00:08:41,103
Oh?

166
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,191
There's a lot of old books! 
How nice...

167
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,401
Oh! Maybe we can sell them in the town!

168
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,112
Hey, we're not thieves!

169
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,281
I'll just borrow this poetry anthology.

170
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,160
Damn this ship, it was a false alarm.

171
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,037


172
00:08:59,087 --> 00:08:59,539
Ouch!

173
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,915
Oww, that hurts...

174
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,874


175
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,668
Ow, ow...

176
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,086
Soraya!

177
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,629
What are you doing?

178
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,925
It seems the floor was rotten!

179
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,593


180
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,594


181
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,143
How was over there?

182
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,186
No problem.

183
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,729
I see a problem!

184
00:09:24,854 --> 00:09:25,356
It hurts...

185
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,275
Then, let's take down that flag 
and go back.

186
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,234


187
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,320
If they got rescued they could have
taken it down.

188
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,364
It just makes it confusing.

189
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,576
Right... it never rains but it pours...

190
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,079
An airship?

191
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,163
Ah!

192
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,375
Gibbs! Pull us up, quick!

193
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,334
What happens?

194
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,670
A ship is approaching!

195
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:48,963
A ship?

196
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:49,964


197
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,383
Okay! I'll lower the hooks!

198
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,510
Is there something wrong with that ship?

199
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,137
I have a bad feeling about it.

200
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,514
Pull them up quickly!

201
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,653
They're chasing us.

202
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,490
That outline...

203
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,743
Ah, Jiro-san!

204
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,119
I'll watch from above!

205
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,622
Rise at full speed, 10 to starboard.

206
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,581
Yes!

207
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,167
So the rescue ship was just a bait...

208
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:27,835
Shit!

209
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,760
They're faster than us!

210
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,597
Vanabelle's bad feeling was right.

211
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,223


212
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,225
For real?

213
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,312
They're air pirates.

214
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,280
Boy, we're so lucky a draking vessel
fell for it!

215
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,200
They probably have dragon oil onboard.

216
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,535
Nice steering they've got there.

217
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,747
But I won't let you escape.

218
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,711
They're catching up!

219
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:14,256
I don't want to use more fuel 
for mere pirates, but...

220
00:11:15,582 --> 00:11:16,842
It's the same as always...

221
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,345
Okay, let's go!

222
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:36,737


223
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,031
Their helmsman is very good!

224
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:40,616


225
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,120


226
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,246


227
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,623


228
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,042
Ahh! Our run-down ship is getting
even more run-down...!

229
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,210
Hey!

230
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,130
This is not the time to say that!

231
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,214


232
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:57,716


233
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,973


234
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,644
Takita! Crouch down!

235
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,146


236
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,321
Ugh... why?

237
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,282
Idiot! Don't stand there dumbfounded!

238
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:22,950
I'm sorry!

239
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:24,618


240
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,287
Hey... your eyelid...

241
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,081
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.

242
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,625
Takita!

243
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,843
How dare they...

244
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,761
They don't even care for women
and children?!

245
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,305
Everyone, go inside! Quick!

246
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:54,773


247
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:55,900
You bastard...!

248
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,277


249
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,989
When I shoot one, ten come back...

250
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,533
We can't fight a machine gun with
single shot guns!

251
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,745
Bridge! We're at a disadvantage
in this position.

252
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,747
At least raise the ship over them!

253
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,415
We know!

254
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,251
We gotta do it, then!

255
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,337
Jiro here! I arrived to the lookout.

256
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,506
They plan to board our ship!

257
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,799
What?! Tsk...

258
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:22,843


259
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,345
A kite?!

260
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,263
They intend to board us from 
the lookout.

261
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,431
This is bad...

262
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,724
Jiro! Get out of there!

263
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:32,561
Vanabelle, cover me when I go out.

264
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:33,562
What are you going to do?

265
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,607
I'm gonna board them instead.

266
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:38,901
Mika...

267
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:39,944
Mika!

268
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,487
Eh?!

269
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,446
Mika-san!

270
00:13:52,113 --> 00:13:53,082
Oh, no...

271
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,833
Eh... Mika?!

272
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:03,425
Ah?

273
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:06,428


274
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,097


275
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:15,229
This thing isn't made to aim for
small targets...

276
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:16,605


277
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,065


278
00:14:19,941 --> 00:14:20,818
Niko!

279
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,194


280
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,531
What did you say about small targets?

281
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,491


282
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:31,412
Hey! What are you waiting for?
Board them already!

283
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,625
You guys! Are you ready?

284
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:37,960


285
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,253


286
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,172


287
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,258
Ah? What's he...?

288
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,637
Ah!! Wait, you!

289
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,014


290
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,932


291
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:53,767


292
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,060


293
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,401
Wha- He's acting on his own again!

294
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:03,861
Why are you surprised?

295
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,286
Ah- Eh, wha?!

296
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,831


297
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,584
No way, no way, no waaaay!

298
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,002


299
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,212


300
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,007
That's dangerous!

301
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,135
He boarded us alone!

302
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,304
Is he sane?

303
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,473
Don't flinch! Shoot him!

304
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,557


305
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,644


306
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:38,562


307
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,105


308
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:43,984


309
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:46,695


310
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,742
Don't move!


311
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:52,910
Ouch...

312
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,745
Put your hands up and kneel down!

313
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,622
Hurry up!

314
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:58,916
Mika-san!

315
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,919
Mika!

316
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,713
Tsk...

317
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,174
This is bad...

318
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,676
-Mika!
-Mika...

319
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,136
Ow, it hurts...

320
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,056
You're pretty good, huh...

321
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:18,352
Look what you did, you ruined
my pretty face...

322
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,645


323
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,231
I'll leave your face full of holes too!

324
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,234
Be grateful.

325
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,653


326
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,198


327
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:34,868


328
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,246
Ah... F-freeze...!

329
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,915
Hey! Can't you see the gun?

330
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,126


331
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,085


332
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,754


333
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,134


334
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:50,844
Sto-...

335
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,804


336
00:16:57,682 --> 00:16:59,059
Bullshit...

337
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,980
I've never seen someone who'd
board a pirate ship alone...

338
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,441
Never in my life!

339
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,152
Who on earth are you?

340
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,529
Just a draker.

341
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,574


342
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,783


343
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,038
Owww...

344
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,539
Hey.

345
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,583
Do you have meat?

346
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,335
What? Meat?

347
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,504
Yeah, meat.

348
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,053


349
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:35,679
Ohh!

350
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,098
You eat surprisingly well, huh?

351
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,143
I'll give you as much as you want,
but get out of here...

352
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,811
What's this bundle?

353
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,689
We happened to get some 
good dragon meat...

354
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:46,648


355
00:17:49,076 --> 00:17:49,610
Oh!

356
00:17:51,286 --> 00:17:55,062
"Lean dragon meat pastrami, pirate-style"

357
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,326


358
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,329
You're making the spices work really well!

359
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,997
The fragance is great too.

360
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,666
This smoked meat looks really good...

361
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,251
What kind of dish is this?


362
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,295
Pa... Pastrami!

363
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:12,424
It's our family's secret recipe 
that uses a special spice blend!

364
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,634
I see!

365
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,928
And our special spice blend is 

366
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,222
clove, cinnamon, and nutmeg

367
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,599
all mixed together, you see.

368
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:24,228
It's a high-class item, 
also called allspice!

369
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,481
Savour it thoroughly!

370
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,155
Delicious!

371
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:37,908
Eh?

372
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,744


373
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,581


374
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:50,045
Shit, it jammed at the worst moment!

375
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,964


376
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:52,923


377
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,843
I lowered my guard because I was hungry.

378
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,804
You were hiding there, huh?

379
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,973


380
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,727
You're the one who shot at Takita, right?

381
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,939
Y... Yes...

382
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,607


383
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,651


384
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,198


385
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,242


386
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,869


387
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,413


388
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,168
Ah! Mika-san!

389
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,419
Hey.

390
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,421
Mika! Are you okay?

391
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,756
They said they'd share food with us.

392
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,425
Eh?

393
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,260
What's going on?

394
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,429
He suppressed it all by himself.

395
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,181
He's messed up.

396
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,223


397
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,434
That's just how he is.

398
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,645
I don't know who are 
the pirates anymore.

399
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:50,689


400
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,108


401
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:54,902
Mika-san?

402
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,082
Looks good.

403
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,126
Ah! A dragon!


404
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,128
Above the clouds! It's inside the sun!

405
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:16,632
Ohh! It looks pretty voluminous too!

406
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,343
We'll leave as soon as Mika's up!

407
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,428


408
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,431
Jiro, don't lose sight of it!

409
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,391
Everyone, to your positions!

410
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,227
For the love of god, please catch it!

411
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,688
If you let it go, I won't be able
to pay your salaries!

412
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,615
They were... amazing...

413
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,368
Yeah... they're something else...

414
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,622
Drakers... huh...

415
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,056


416
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,146


417
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,731
He looks so happy.

418
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:26,952
♪〜
