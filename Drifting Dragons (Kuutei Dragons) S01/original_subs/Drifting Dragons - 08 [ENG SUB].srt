1
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:06,548
Good thing this didn't burn.

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:07,507
Right!

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:10,010
That's our prey, to begin with.

4
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:14,055
As if I could let them take
300 barrel of dragon oil from
under our noses!

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,183
We'll finish it off.

6
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:20,395


7
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:23,815


8
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:25,533
Did it work?

9
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,657


10
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,874


11
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,418


12
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,963
No way!

13
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:47,922


14
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,010
That's dangerous!

15
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,597
Those jerks just added 
more fuel to the fire!

16
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,183
Engine room! How long until takeoff?!

17
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,269
We can't do more than this!

18
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,646


19
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:04,606
This is bad!

20
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:08,443


21
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,819


22
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,071


23
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,953


24
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,206


25
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,751


26
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,172
How the fuck isn't it dead
after all those bombs?

27
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,548


28
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:34,636
It should be dead with all the poison,
I can't believe it!

29
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,976


30
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,105


31
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,942
Ah...! There is the...!

32
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,028


33
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,196
We shook it off...

34
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,280
Yeah...

35
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,077


36
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,079


37
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,336


38
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,213
Well... thanks for doing something stupid!

39
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,216
The plan begins now! 
Be on time for once in your lives!

40
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,468
Goddamnit...

41
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,053
Now's our time to move!

42
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,388
Yeah!

43
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:26,187
I'm sure this was
because we let our guard down.

44
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:31,067
Even though we barely knew anything
about how dragons lived.

45
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,028
This tragedy...

46
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,699
Was something we drakers 
brought upon ourselves.

47
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,367

48
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:46,583
♪〜

49
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:09,249
〜♪

50
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,255
Ah... what a terrible sight...

51
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,214
Bridge!

52
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,633
I can't aim with so many obstacles!

53
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,178
Raise our course and find me a place
with a clear line of fire!

54
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:25,223
Ah? What happened to the plan?

55
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,517
We're in the middle of the city!

56
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,435
Is there a place like that?

57
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,650
This looks awful...

58
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,568
You can't tell there was
a town here...

59
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:41,155
At least it seems that
all the people here evacuated safely...

60
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,657
Ah! Jiro-san!

61
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,659
What were you doing here?

62
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:45,785


63
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,167


64
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,546
Mika...

65
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,464
It can't fly anymore.

66
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,134
Let's put it out of its misery.

67
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,469
Oh?

68
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,888
Is that building over there
an oil refinery?

69
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,473
You're kidding!

70
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,268
It if catches fire all this area
will be a sea of flames!

71
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,227


72
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,687
-Ah...
-Mika-san!

73
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,356
Can't help it! We'll finish it
off right here!

74
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,858
Vadakin! You and the rest go 
surround it!

75
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,985
Understood! You guys, come with me!

76
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,445
-Yeah!
-Yes, sir!

77
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,739


78
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,491


79
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,660
-Let's all cover Mika!
-Roger!

80
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:28,661
Fire!

81
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:29,662


82
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,748


83
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,791


84
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,502


85
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,714
It doesn't seem to do anything!

86
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,673


87
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,509
What the hell is the 
air team doing?

88
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:46,262


89
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:52,268
Isn't it because the dragon is
in a place where the Quin Zaza can't aim?

90
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,686
Yeah, that's what it seems.

91
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,730
We didn't think we would be 
fighting in the middle of the streets!

92
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,858
Shit! That Gibbs, 
what shitty plan is this?

93
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,486
We're almost out of bomb lances!

94
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,779
This big bastard...

95
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,073
In that case how about switching to
stun lances, Takita?

96
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,032
Right away!

97
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,077
Vannie-san!

98
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,996
Please, work...

99
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,709


100
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:17,668


101
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,962


102
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:24,675
There's no effect!

103
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,929
The bullets we are firing 
can't cause it to bleed enough!

104
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,931
They aren't even breaking 
through its skin!

105
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,683
What a waste... these aren't cheap!

106
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,935
Hey!

107
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,606


108
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,608
It's too dangerous, run!

109
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,030
If guns don't work...

110
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,699
Guess I'll go with this.

111
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,952
Mika-san!

112
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,871
Is he planning to stab that monster
with only a spear?

113
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,331
Mika is going there, don't fire!

114
00:06:57,633 --> 00:06:58,751
We can't run anymore.

115
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,630
Niko! Cover me!

116
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:03,965
Oh, hey! Don't give me that you too!

117
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:04,924


118
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,385
Tsk...

119
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,888
Isn't he starting to act like Mika?

120
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,517


121
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:19,021


122
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,403


123
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,197


124
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,992


125
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,454


126
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,496


127
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:37,582


128
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,333


129
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,003


130
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,004


131
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,506


132
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,716


133
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,092


134
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,594
-Mika!
-Mika-san!

135
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,471
I told ya!

136
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,014


137
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:53,973
Mika-san!

138
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,142


139
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,894
Are you okay?

140
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,479
You're bleeding a lot...

141
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,564
Takita...

142
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,066
Bring me... bring me a spear.

143
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,444
What are you saying? 
You can't go with that wound!

144
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,945
You'll die!

145
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,364
There's already

146
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,867
one of our spears stabbed in its body.

147
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,787
Now's our prey.

148
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,665
We must hunt it properly...

149
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,709
And eat it whole!

150
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:22,752


151
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:27,632
Hunt, dissect and eat...

152
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,218
That's all drakers are about.

153
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,511


154
00:08:32,636 --> 00:08:33,593
See? You can't go like that...

155
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,081
It's impossible!

156
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,350
Ah! This looks bad!

157
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,519


158
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,564
It's going to burn all of us
with its heat ray!

159
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,149


160
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,404
-What the hell's that?
-Looks dangerous!

161
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,326
-Wait, wait, wait!
-This again?!

162
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,661
Everyone, retreat!

163
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,871
Hurry up! Evade its line of fire!

164
00:08:58,996 --> 00:08:59,997
Where is it aiming though?

165
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,457
Shut up and run!

166
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,716
Ah... we failed...

167
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,265


168
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,016


169
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:20,768


170
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,603
Wait... Jiro-san?

171
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,398
Hey... what the hell is he doing?!

172
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,903


173
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,155


174
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,615
Look! Right there!

175
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,741
It's Jiro!

176
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,368
He's climbing onto the dragon!

177
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,287


178
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,124
Eh? Jiro-san?

179
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,083


180
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,960


181
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,420


182
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,423


183
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,217


184
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,928
There's... no time to lose!

185
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,930
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!

186
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:58,889
Run away, you idiot!

187
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,808
Wait! Jiro...!

188
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:01,934


189
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,819


190
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,781


191
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,658


192
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:22,788


193
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,081


194
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:30,713


195
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,135


196
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,221
How can I run after all of this?!

197
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,974


198
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,560


199
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,486


200
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,113
 

201
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,410
If I shoot the weak point 
in its spine...

202
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,162
If it's at point-blank...!

203
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,372


204
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,831


205
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,752


206
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,006


207
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,008


208
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:20,930


209
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,363


210
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,949
Not yet... I can't give up yet!

211
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:42,952


212
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:44,995


213
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,497


214
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,083
Jirooo!!

215
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,586


216
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,422



217
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,343


218
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:03,973
Are you for real?

219
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,975


220
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,643
It's the Quin Zaza!

221
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,019
Way to go.

222
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,354


223
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,564


224
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,608
Hey! Do this more carefully!

225
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,235
Do you plan to wreck the ship 
or what?

226
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,989
Crocco-san, didn't you tell me
to ram it without fear?!

227
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,407
I did say to ram it but...

228
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,284
I didn't say it was okay to
break the ship in half!

229
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,744
I can't do one without the other!

230
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,121
Ah!

231
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,622
It's going to fall apart!

232
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:29,665
Quick! Reverse the engine!

233
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,459
Cha-changing gears!

234
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,751
Wah! We're falling down!

235
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,253
Increasing power!

236
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,133


237
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:40,843


238
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,555


239
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,514


240
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,728


241
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,195


242
00:12:59,420 --> 00:12:59,954
Be careful!

243
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,573


244
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:03,991
Niko!

245
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,702
Are you... hurt?

246
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:07,661


247
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,205
-We did it!
-Finally!

248
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,248


249
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,375
They pulled quite a stunt...

250
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:17,463
I can't imagine what Lee-san
is gonna say about this...

251
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,048


252
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,174
Ah...!

253
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,636
Jiro! Well done!

254
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,013
You attracted its attention
flawlessly!

255
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,515


256
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:29,934
Let's go!

257
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,645
Yeaaah!

258
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,777
-It is really over? 
-Did they kill it?

259
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,488
Hey! The city's all ruins now!

260
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,491
Ah! My precious bar!

261
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,868
Shit... why did this happen to me...

262
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,162


263
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:55,543
In the end... we needed 
each and every spear to finish it off...

264
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,919


265
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,964
We're pretty sloppy drakers, huh?

266
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,217
Ah... all this bleeding...

267
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,678
Doesn't it hurt?

268
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,555
It hurts like hell

269
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,266
'cause I'm still alive.

270
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,942
Ahh... our poor little ship.

271
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,361
What are you taking the ship for?

272
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,364
The airscrews are fine!
You can fly away!

273
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,907


274
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,993
Ah... I'm so glad...

275
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,452


276
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,329
Well, I'm not glad!

277
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,540
We're doing damage control as
soon as we dock!

278
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:38,878


279
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,005
Mmm?

280
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,425
Jiro!

281
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,844
Eh...? Katja!

282
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,345
I'm so glad you're safe!

283
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,430


284
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,472
Yeah!

285
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,100
I was so worried when I saw
the bar destroyed!

286
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,435
Everyone evacuated and we're 
safe and sound.

287
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,394


288
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,855


289
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,316


290
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,860
Thank god...

291
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,570
Don't exagerate.

292
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,071
I was really worried.

293
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,367
Oh? Really worried about me?

294
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,368
Ah...!

295
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,495
A-... about everyone!

296
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,999
That brat! As soon as I take
my eyes off him...

297
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,001
Getting a head start, eh?

298
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,628
Not bad for him, the scoundrel!

299
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,130
Waah! What a pretty girl!

300
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,340
Phew!

301
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:25,591


302
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,135


303
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,723
So... without further ado!
A little kiss of reunion.

304
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,808
Eh... wai- Huh?!

305
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:35,976


306
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:36,936
You can't treat a customer like that!

307
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,396


308
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,692
It won't move anymore?

309
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:44,985
Yeah.

310
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,029
You guys put it down finally.

311
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,949
Yeah... you can say that.

312
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,869
Now that I look at it closely
it's pretty frightening.

313
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,038
Are you gonna dissect it right away?

314
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,247
Yeah...

315
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:01,043
But, since it has poison in its
system and we fired stun lances at it...

316
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,504
Even if we dissect it...

317
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,798
It is not good enough to sell it?

318
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:06,966
It's not like that.

319
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,593
But its value has gone down
quite considerably.

320
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:13,055
Though that's only a problem
we have to face ourselves.

321
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:14,431


322
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,226
Value... huh?

323
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,062
Ah, what's that?

324
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,064
A fight? I wonder...

325
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,149
Well? What are you going to do?

326
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:27,277
Because of your "little" mistake
the city has suffered a tragedy!

327
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,446
You are able to fly in the sky

328
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,700
because this city buys all it can
from you, drakers!

329
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,910
And you thank us like this?!

330
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:38,205
If we didn't bring dragons here,

331
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,957
the ones who couldn't live 
would be you!

332
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,543
We are always risking our lives
up there!

333
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,921
Uh! Now you've said it!
Who do you think you are?!

334
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,716
Drop it! This is not the time
to be fighting.

335
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:49,675
Ah?

336
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,635
What's your problem?
Are you one of his friends?

337
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,096
It's not that I am his friend...

338
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,973
Though I am a draker too...

339
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,599
What are you saying, bastard?

340
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,811
Are you saying it's that lil' puny ship
of yours who caught it?

341
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,229
I'm not saying anything like that...

342
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,355
It doesn't look good...

343
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,481


344
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,985
The city of Quon is a very 
important place as a base for drakers.

345
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,486
I don't want them to hold a grudge
against us.

346
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,613
No, rather than that...

347
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:14,241
If things remain like this,
no one here will buy this dragon.

348
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,826
Bunch of idiots!

349
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,370
Ah! Captain!

350
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,040
Why are you causing problems
to these people?!

351
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,458
Are you sure you can walk like that?

352
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,251
If you can worry about that...

353
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,755
Don't go causing unnecesary problems,
you damn spineless rubble!

354
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,217
If you have energy to pick fights
you'd better use it to pick debris instead!

355
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,552
But... that's not the...

356
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,554
I don't give a damn 
about your excuses!

357
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,057


358
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:42,311
I see that dealing with incompetent
crew looks the same wherever you go.

359
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,563
Yeah, there are people like that.

360
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,315
-Ah? And you're one of them!
-Oh?!

361
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,816
Hey, what do you mean?!

362
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,151
Confirmed incompetent!

363
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,235
Listen!

364
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,114
If it was not for this boy,
you'd probably all be dead by now.

365
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,533
If another heat ray went off...

366
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,702
The destruction wouldn't have ended here.

367
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,538


368
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:06,752
But... the damages are so serious...

369
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,880
-Gibbs-san.
-Mmm?

370
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,673
Let's donate the dragon to the city.

371
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,633
Ah?

372
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,592
Huh?

373
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,928
Lee-san, what the hell are you saying?!

374
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,055
Besides the damages to the city
being so serious...

375
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:23,811
If we were to take advantage of the situation
and profit, it's the same as asking for a rebellion.

376
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,938
The real good deal for us is...

377
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,857
To trade the dragon in exchange for 
ship repairs and the rest of the expenses.

378
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,109
Wait, wait, wait!

379
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,611
Do you not see how difficult was
for us to take that dragon down?!

380
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,781
You won't see a single coin
if we can't sell it.

381
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,366


382
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,742


383
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,371
Ah... I wonder what Crocco 
would say if he knew this...

384
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,081
I don't mind...

385
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,375
Crocco!

386
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,709
As long as they repair our
ship, I don't mind.

387
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,545
Well, that's settled.

388
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,132
Ah... not much we can do 
about it after all.

389
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,343
Ahhh... what a waste of effort...

390
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,762
Let's call it even for both of us, okay?

391
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,765
Ah! It better be enough food
for me after this!

392
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,100
Ah...

393
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,602
All this bleeding made me hungry.

394
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:09,106
I think losing blood has nothing to do
with being hungry...

395
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,317
I will be at Gramps Ura's place
eating some meat.

396
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:16,280
Okay! We are going to clean up
the city too, Mika!

397
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,574
Ugh... let me go!

398
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,367
I'm injured, goddamnit!

399
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,536
This isn't the strength of
an injured man, is it?

400
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,745
Let me go I tell you!

401
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,665
-Shut your mouth and come!
-As pleasant as always...

402
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,960
Mmmm... I think he'll be fine.

403
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,962


404
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:35,340
Good grief... they are always
causing problems.

405
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,800


406
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,637
Yes, they are your friends 
after all, Jiro.

407
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,264
Of course!

408
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,729


409
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,522
They're a good bunch.

410
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,784
Listen...

411
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,330
Katja, I'm sorry.

412
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,289
Mmm?

413
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,543
The festival... 
We pretty much ruined it.

414
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,213
Even after I promised you 
we'd come together.

415
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,881


416
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,430


417
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:26,892


418
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,064


419
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:33,941


420
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,610


421
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:37,570


422
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,238


423
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,573


424
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,200


425
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,745


426
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,122


427
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,582


428
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:52,793


429
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,462
Ah... sorry.

430
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:00,092
Your face was so serious, 
I couldn't hold my laugh!

431
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,176
Eh?!

432
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,219
Ah...

433
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,721


434
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,518
-But...
-Mmm?

435
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,353
I sure wanted to see...

436
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,983
The moment you hunted
the dragon, Jiro.

437
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:26,952
♪〜
