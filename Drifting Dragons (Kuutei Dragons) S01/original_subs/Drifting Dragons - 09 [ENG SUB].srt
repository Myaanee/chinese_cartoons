1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:03,294


2
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:05,630


3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,258


4
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:12,387
Well, this will be worth dissecting!

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,182


6
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,600
Mika-san,

7
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,145
are all those people 
dissection masters too?

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,149
Yeah, they undertake the dissection
of huge dragons.

9
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:28,403
I see... their tools have a very
particular shape too.

10
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,922
Aw, man... where did 
our vacation go...

11
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:31,906


12
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,616
Ugh... booze...

13
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:37,412
This is not what we were told...
Yesterday was fun, though...

14
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,039
I'm so sleepy...

15
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,248


16
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,709
Come on, guys, don't be lazy!

17
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:45,795
Hey, if there are dissection 
masters and all...

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,047
Why do we have to do it too?

19
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,341
That's what you get for the mess
you caused at the bar.

20
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,301


21
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,387
Stop complaining and do it!
C'mon, go to the altar!

22
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,347
Riiiiight...

23
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,934
Can we pray too?

24
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,894
Yes.

25
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,353
-Let's go.
-Yes!

26
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:06,524
Rest... and return...

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,904
To the skies, to the skies...

28
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:15,283
Be one with the earth,
one with the life...

29
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:19,162
With the life...

30
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,917
Return thee... return thee...

31
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:27,045
Fortunately, no one was hurt
in this incident...

32
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,756
But the city was badly damaged.

33
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,176
We wanted to be of help
even if it was only a little bit...

34
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,805
So we drakers ended up helping
with the dissection all together.

35
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:41,518
I'm more than glad to help the city,

36
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,520
but...

37
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,898
we can't even think about the festival now.

38
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:53,655
♪〜

39
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:16,195
〜♪

40
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,407


41
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,619
Okay, great, over here, don't stop...

42
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,828
Hey! Don't push it!

43
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,040
Thanks for the help, we didn't 
have enough people.

44
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:31,502
No problem, I was just thinking
what should I do for the crew's lunch.

45
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,463
You really don't mind
giving me so many ingredients?

46
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:37,258
Yeah, since the festival was cancelled
we weren't going to use them anyway.

47
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,802
If they're gonna go bad,
I'd rather use them for emergency food.

48
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,431
The townsfolk are working hard
on reconstructing the city, too.

49
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,934


50
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,518
I see!

51
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,229
So, we're making soup?

52
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,482
Nope, it's something that was made
so that peasants could have lunch outside.

53
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,859
Local cuisine that can be cooked
in a cauldron.

54
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,196
Ohh, then that's perfect 
for emergency food indeed.

55
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,822
Not as much as you'd think!

56
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:00,782
Huh?

57
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,493
Melt the dragon fat in the cauldron,

58
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:08,623
put in some caraway and onion and 
stir-fry it until it gets a golden colour.

59
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,582
Yeah, yeah...

60
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:13,628
Hey, you! You better not put
potatoes in there!

61
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,255
-Ah... there we go.
-Of course I will!

62
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,591
Tsk! We don't put that thing in it!

63
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,260
Hey...

64
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,178
This has no bacon!

65
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,137
What?

66
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,598


67
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,350
That's goulash, isn't it?

68
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,143
If you don't fry the bacon
with the onion,

69
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,937
it will taste bad!

70
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,648
Katja, go get some from the
bar's kitchen, will you?

71
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,774
Sure.

72
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,485
Leave this one to me.

73
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,196
Ah... okay, okay.

74
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,615
See? I told you.

75
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,368
This kind of dish is cooked
differently in every family.

76
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,413
Everyone thinks theirs is the best 
and that's why they always argue.

77
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:50,331
I see.

78
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,875
By the way, what about the meat?

79
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:57,171
From what I see, it's all dragon meat,
but of many types and parts.

80
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,215
You can put whatever meat 
you want, right?

81
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,174
Yeah.

82
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,303
Actually, putting a lot of different
kinds of meat is the Quon city style.

83
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,262
Yep, yep.

84
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,847
I see.

85
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,141
This is a city where 
many different dragons gather,


86
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,727
so it's a taste you only can find here.

87
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:14,147
And on top of this, some meat
cut in big sized pieces,

88
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,358
sprinkle some salt, and...

89
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:21,279
Enough powdered paprika 
to cover all the meat.

90
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,449
Eh, you're putting that much? 
It's bright red!

91
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:28,202
And then, garlic and 
celery tied with a thread.

92
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:32,665
Diced tomatoes, paprika and water...

93
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,252
And we let it simmer for 2 whole hours.

94
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,464
Ohh, I'm looking forward to this!

95
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,183


96
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,351


97
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,104
Where did you learn that?

98
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,731
I've done it once before.

99
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,738
Wow, those two are good at this.

100
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,119


101
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,331
Gibbs-san, sorry for the wait!

102
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,290
Okay, get up here!

103
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,043
Eh? What is it?

104
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,544
We're gonna scoop out some brain oil.

105
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,254
Brain oil?

106
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:24,008
It's a very high-grade oil accumulated
in the head. We were very lucky,

107
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,220
because not all dragons have this.

108
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,139
We're going to get inside it
and pump it out.

109
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,182
Wait... what?!

110
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,393
Inside... its head?

111
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,146
Ugh... for real?

112
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:41,484
What can we do? We're the smallest
around here.

113
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,443
Ugh...

114
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,196


115
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,322


116
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,157
Eh?

117
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,408


118
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,660
Takita, hurry it up!

119
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,328
Come on!

120
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,955
It's so sticky...

121
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,123


122
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,374


123
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,126


124
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,128
Ow...

125
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,172
Ew, it smells fishy...

126
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,466
This is also a draker's job...

127
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,511
And then, when the potatoes
and carrots are cooked...

128
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,288
It's done.

129
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,223


130
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,349
Good.

131
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,101


132
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,562


133
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:18,688


134
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:19,897
-Um...
-Yeah?

135
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,525
You're in Jiro's ship, right?

136
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,360
Eh? Yeah...

137
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,279
How is he like?

138
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,574
Jiro, huh...

139
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,492
Let's see...

140
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,911
Ahhh, I'm so hungry!

141
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,664
-Lunch time!
-It smells so good!

142
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,375
Working for free sure makes you
hungrier than usual.

143
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,376
Good job out there.

144
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,544
Oh, Katja!

145
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,630
You cooked too?

146
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,549
-Only a bit.
-I see!

147
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,800


148
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,177


149
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,305
Well, while we wait for this to
finish cooking...

150
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,640
Let's make another thing over there!

151
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,184


152
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,604
This is the red meat of the dragon
we brought to this city.

153
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,231
Ah, the one I dissected!

154
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,400
We'll simply just hit it!

155
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:05,776
Hit it?

156
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,322
We'll hit it as if we were pulling it
and stretch it thin.

157
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,865
Ah, I want to do it!

158
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,867


159
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,704


160
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:17,997
How about this?

161
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,874
Yeah, well done.

162
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,376
Then, some salt and pepper,

163
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,504
sprinkle some flour,

164
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:29,217
coat it evenly with egg
and cover it with cheese
mixed with breadcrumbs.

165
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:34,263
Melt some dragon fat and butter
in a big frypan, and...

166
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,640
One, two...!

167
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,850


168
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:39,894


169
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,229


170
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,730
Could this be...

171
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,316
-Yoshi-san, this is...!
-Yeah.

172
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,610
You've been wanting to eat it
for a long time, right?

173
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,363
Good, that's a nice colour.

174
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:51,948
Hop!

175
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,912
A dragon cutlet, extra large!

176
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,455


177
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,957
Oh boy, what's this smell?

178
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,208
This is...

179
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:06,045
Man, this can't go wrong in any way!

180
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,922
Yoshi-san, you're the best!

181
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,465
Then, let's eat it togeth...

182
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,510
Ahh!!

183
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,346
Wait, Mika-san! That's for everyone!

184
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,597


185
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,015
Damn you...!

186
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,768
Hey! Someone get Mika away 
from the cutlet!

187
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,395
He's gonna eat it all!

188
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,648
Don't monopolize it!

189
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:26,649


190
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,944
Say, the people from your ship
are always like this?

191
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,737
Ah... yeah.

192
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,906
It looks so fun, how nice!

193
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,534
Yep!

194
00:09:39,731 --> 00:09:42,591
"Dragon cutlet and Quon-style goulash"

195
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,418
So good!

196
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,045
Ah, Faye! Your cutlet 
is bigger than mine!

197
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,797
Aw come on, you're so fussy.

198
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,800


199
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,055
Gibbs, do we have any more 
work after this?

200
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,390


201
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,976
We're supposed to continue 
until sunset...

202
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,103
Ah... I see.

203
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,523
Ah... I see...

204
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,693
Yoshi-san, seconds!

205
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,778
How many seconds have you eaten?

206
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,948
-Okay, line up!
-That's unfair for the others!

207
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,408
Just a little bit!

208
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,827
-Here, for you, Jiro.
-Thank you.

209
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,330
This is the specialty of our city.

210
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,374
And we add bacon to the goulash, you know?

211
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,917
Wow!

212
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,006
Oh! So good!

213
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,717


214
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,804


215
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,140
This somehow looks...

216
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,893
Like a festival, don't you think?

217
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,687
It's true!

218
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,899
Mika-san, you're eating too much!

219
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,485
Might as well just drink some alcohol!

220
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,486
Ah?!

221
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,696
I'm joking...

222
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,448
I think a glass won't hurt.

223
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,407
Damn right!

224
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,534
Stop yelling!

225
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,119


226
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,334
So... about the method 
to extract the poison.

227
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,422
Add a lot of salt and water
that has been boiled once to rice bran,

228
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,841
and just pickle the meat in that.

229
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:16,967
Rice bran?

230
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,552
And that will extract the poison?

231
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:22,515
The wisdom of our ancestors is
not to be taken lightly.

232
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,474
Ohh...

233
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:28,521
Put the meat and the rice bran
alternatively in a pottery jar,

234
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:32,233
close it with a lid, and seal it with a cloth.

235
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,528
Bury it for about three years in the earth,

236
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,030
and wait for the poison to disappear.

237
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,490
I see...!

238
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:44,912


239
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,124
What did you just say?

240
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,293
I never said that you could
eat it right away...

241
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,462
Ah! Wait, Mika-san!

242
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,880
What are you doing 
to the poor old man!

243
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,466


244
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:58,926
Three years...

245
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,429
Mika, help us fill the jars.

246
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,388


247
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,433


248
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,684


249
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:11,188
Well, time for us to go back
to our own job.

250
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,523


251
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,485
Katja! Let's go.

252
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:17,486


253
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:34,003
At this rate, I think we'll
finish dissecting it today.

254
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,715
Then I guess we can leave 
tomorrow morning.

255
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,800
Yes, please do that.

256
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:40,843
What?!

257
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:45,890
We were able to refuel and repair
the ship, but our gains are essentially none.

258
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,558
We can't even think of a vacation...

259
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:51,061
I... guess that's true, but...

260
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,271
My massage...

261
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,564
What?

262
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,691
It's... it's nothing.

263
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,027
I do understand how you feel, though.

264
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,279
But we shouldn't stay long here.

265
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:04,325
For the sake of the people
of this city as well, we should leave soon.

266
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,367
Right...

267
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,495
It's true...

268
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,498


269
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,209
Ah, Mika-san! You're skipping work again!

270
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,795
Wha? We finished dissecting it, 
so what does it matter?

271
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,255
Geez...

272
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,761
We're leaving in the morning, huh?

273
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,305
Hm? Yeah.

274
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,682
Too bad we couldn't see the festival.

275
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,059
Ahhh!

276
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,395
I really wanted to eat that dragon.

277
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,940
Hey, what do you think it tastes like?

278
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:36,899
Eh...

279
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,026
I don't know about that yet...

280
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,862
Ahh, good grief! It's finally over!

281
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,240
It took three whole days...

282
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,699
That dragon was way too huge!

283
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:49,954
That's all we can do. 
Now it's up to the townspeople.

284
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,455
Good job today!

285
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,708
Oh, Takita, you too, you worked hard.

286
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,294
Okay, it's time! Time to drink!

287
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,671
Yeah, nice voice there!

288
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,548
We need to prepare for the departure.

289
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,507
Whaaat?

290
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,551
For real...?

291
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,344


292
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,512
Takita, where's Jiro?

293
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,389
Wasn't he with you?

294
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,307
He said he was going back first.

295
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,267


296
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,435
Well, isn't it fine?

297
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,609
Jiro...!

298
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,444


299
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,029
Sorry for the wait.

300
00:14:25,338 --> 00:14:26,240
Come with me!

301
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,283
Where are we going?

302
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,040
Wow, what is this?

303
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,500
It's called autogyro.

304
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,045
The guys from the other ship 
gave it to us in gratitude.

305
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,631
Here, put this on!

306
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:43,591


307
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,969
I practiced a lot until 
I was able to ride it well!

308
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,138


309
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,639
Katja, hop on!

310
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,308
Eh? What?

311
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:53,809


312
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,396
Hold onto me tight!

313
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,355
Sure!

314
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,574


315
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,160
Up we go!

316
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,458


317
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,001


318
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,797
Wow!!

319
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,640
I'm flying!

320
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:01,669


321
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,390
You said you had never
left the city, right?

322
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,391
Eh?

323
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,022


324
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:32,908
Look.

325
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,411
We're outside the city.

326
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:42,960


327
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,503


328
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,261
When the sun finishes rising...

329
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:57,683
We'll... leave the town.

330
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,195
I see...

331
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,573
Katja...

332
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,243
Will you...

333
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,328
come with me...

334
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,288


335
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,547
to the ship...

336
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,802
Don't...

337
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,931
If you talk that much...

338
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,476
you'll bite your tongue...

339
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,842
Ohh, it's wonderful!

340
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,969
Thank you so much for bringing it!

341
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,305
I'll add this to the tapestry too.

342
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,183
Also, Takita, put out your arm.

343
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,142
Hm?

344
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:23,936
Oh...!

345
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,354
It's an amulet I made with a scrap.

346
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:30,317
Also, an ointment made with the mucus
of a small kind of dragon called salamandra.

347
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,113
It's good for erasing scars.

348
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,951
Nanami-san... Thank you so much!

349
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,829


350
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,831
Make sure you come back.

351
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,415
Yesh!

352
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,085
We're gonna leave, get boarding!

353
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,003
Riiiight.

354
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,089
Be well.

355
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,634
For the time you come back, 
the meat will most likely be edible.

356
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,220
You better leave some for me!

357
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,765


358
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,892
Back to living in the sky again, huh?

359
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,978
The sky's our lover, I guess.

360
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,022
-Sadly...
-What the hell?

361
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,234
I should get going too.

362
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,444
Well then, Katja...

363
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,946


364
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,035
Jiro...

365
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,580
Katja...

366
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,921
I'm gonna cut your hair!

367
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:32,540
Eh?

368
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,673
With this, you kind of 
look like a girl.

369
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,967
It won't take me more than five minutes!

370
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,427
Can you lend me scissors and a sheet?

371
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,054
S-sure, I think we have some in the ship.

372
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,514
Vannie!

373
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,184
Can you lend me a pair of scissors?

374
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,311
I'll return them right away!

375
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,982
Sure... take your time.

376
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,947
I'm so glad I met you.

377
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:02,993
Take care.

378
00:20:32,721 --> 00:20:33,899
Three years, really?

379
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:37,819
Come on... are you still going on
about that, Mika-san?

380
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,780
Freshen up!

381
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,532
Mika!

382
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,909
Let's go to the lookout.

383
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:45,661
Yeah.

384
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,620
-Hm?
-Eh?!

385
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,288
Jiro-san?

386
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,292
Eh?! What happened?!

387
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,169
Why does it matter?

388
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,422
I'll be at the front and 
you at the back, Mika.

389
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,384
U-um, Jiro-san!

390
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,927
Takita.

391
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,222
Boys have a lot going on for them, too.

392
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,432
I'll be at the front.

393
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,892
No, me.

394
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,519
Oh no, it'll be me.

395
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,604
No way in hell, me!

396
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:13,981
-Me at the front!
-Me!!

397
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,232
-Me.
-Me, me!

398
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,191
No, me.

399
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,651
-No, I'll be the one!
-Me.

400
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,820
Why?! I'm also an adult now!

401
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,071
Please, be my guest.

402
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:27,202
