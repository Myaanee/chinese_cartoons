1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,212
Even though they're called draking vessels,

2
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:07,382
it's not like we're fighting dragons
every day.

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:11,386
Actually, it's the everyday work
which is the hardest.

4
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:14,556


5
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,266
Ah... Jiro-san.

6
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,851
Hm? Takita.

7
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,602
-Time to switch?
-Yeah.

8
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,354
You're on laundry duty?

9
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,815
Yes! I'm good at doing laundry.

10
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,191
Really...?

11
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,735
Leave it to me!

12
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,653
Up we go...

13
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,655


14
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,198


15
00:00:33,907 --> 00:00:35,535
Is she gonna be alright...?

16
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,745


17
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,624


18
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,794
How rare for you to have 
a hangover, Vanabelle.

19
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,213
Here, honey and ginger juice.

20
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,758
I just had a drink before sleep...

21
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:54,262
It was a mixed drink...
Cheap alcohol's not good.

22
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:55,930
Spicy...

23
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,682


24
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,643
Yoshi-san, do you have any laundry?


25
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,229
Oh, then take that towel, please.


26
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,981
Oh? Vannie-san.

27
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,733
Are you okay?

28
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,320
I'll help you when I finish this.

29
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,073
It's fine! Please rest.

30
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,326


31
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,204


32
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,081
Any laundry?

33
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,083
Takita, shut up for a bit.

34
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,042
Eh?

35
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,212
This is a fight between men.

36
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,215
If you want to give up, you better
do it before it's too late.

37
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,091
Ha! As if!

38
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,051
Now...

39
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,344
It's on!

40
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,512


41
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,556
Ahh!! Why!!

42
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:39,808


43
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,935
A fight between men...

44
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,937
You should just stop!

45
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,272
Soraya, you're terrible with bets.

46
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:47,482
Shut your mouth, Faye!

47
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,985
You better pay me 
when you get your next wage.

48
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,945


49
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,405
I know...

50
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:55,949


51
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,158
Well, now...

52
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,996
Oh, Takita, good timing.

53
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,331
Pour some water on me.

54
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,625
Is that shampoo? Sure!

55
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,339
It's nice how it's been 
pretty calm lately, right?

56
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,549
What are you saying?

57
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,552
Now's when it gets busy,
so get ready.


58
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,179
Is it gonna be that hectic?

59
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,849
Yeah, it will be like shooting fish
in a barrel.

60
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,934
We can't possibly miss it.

61
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,936
I see...

62
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:29,232
Um? When was the last time 
I washed my hair?

63
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,485
Ah? Want me to lend you some washing powder?

64
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,028
Ah, no...

65
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,574
I have a lot of hair 
and it's troublesome to wash so I kinda...

66
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,576


67
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:41,703
Takita...

68
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,371
Yes...?

69
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,793
Sometimes... you never know 
what you've got till it's gone...

70
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,254
You're actually concerned about it...

71
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:52,922


72
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,966
Wh-what is it, Mika-san?

73
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,467
Do... do I stink?

74
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,303

75
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,637


76
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,514
It's a lot of trouble, but...

77
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:08,187
it's a fun... workplace... yes.

78
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:09,898


79
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:16,529
♪〜

80
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:39,279
〜♪

81
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,866

82
00:04:45,534 --> 00:04:46,244
29%.

83
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,247
29 per cent...

84
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,959
Wow, I can't believe you can guess
the position of the ship so high in the sky.

85
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,002
It's amazing!

86
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:57,380
It's impossible for me, 
I don't understand a thing!

87
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,799
Jiro-san, you're so skillful!

88
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,052
Anyone on a ship should be able
to do this much.

89
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,139
If you follow the process in order,
anyone can do it.

90
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,224
Everyone's just too sloppy.

91
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,518
Gibbs-san said it though!

92
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,730
That your observations are 
the most accurate!

93
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,106
Who teached you?

94
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,817
My dad.

95
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,277
Eh?

96
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,868
My dad... was a draker too.

97
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,123
Ahh! Now I understand!

98
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,292
Your dad must have been outstanding!

99
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,585


100
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,879
He was really irresponsible.

101
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:42,467
Casually coming home, and then
going out again just as casually.


102
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,052
Leaving me and my mom alone.

103
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,345


104
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:51,476
When he came home, 
he only talked about dragons.

105
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,521


106
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,778
There has been not a single sign of them
for the past week.

107
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,821
With this weather, we can't expect much either.

108
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,533
Either way, if we continue like this, 
we'll be deep in the red.

109
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,452
Oh dear...

110
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,913
It shouldn't have been like this...

111
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,623
What do we do, Crocco?

112
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,835
Uh... we also need to refuel already...

113
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,089
Let's go across the sea towards northwest
and find some land.

114
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,216
Excuse me!

115
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,468
-Gibbs-san, here.
-Thanks.

116
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,054
Crocco-san, I think a storm is 
approaching after all.

117
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,013
Ah?

118
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,723
It's true...

119
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,893
The pressure on the mercury column is dropping.

120
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:34,852
Gibbs.

121
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,939
Grab the guys that are off-duty today
and go check if the cargo is properly secured.

122
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,023
Got it.

123
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,441
Okay, let's go.

124
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,484
Yes!

125
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,652
I'll join you later.

126
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:43,736
Sure.

127
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:48,116
Jiro-san, how did you know 
a storm is coming?

128
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,160
Because the wind feels a bit lukewarm.

129
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,411
I see...

130
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,664
Sometimes you can know 
because of the smell, too.

131
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,083
Ah... now that you mention it,

132
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:01,546
I smell something... burning...

133
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:02,964
Eh?


134
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,173


135
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,758
Eh?! A fire?!

136
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:06,926


137
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,678


138
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:09,887

139
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,014
What are you doing?!

140
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,391
Smoking meat.

141
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,269
The fire was too strong and it 
made too much smoke.


142
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,229

143
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,940
You see, we had some old salted meat.

144
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,943
Here's the red meat, and below that, fat meat.

145
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:27,447
We're using grappa from an oak barrel 
so it'll smell really nice!

146
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:31,951
Yep, with every little adjustment
the flavor can change in unexpected ways.


147
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,287
Smoking is pretty deep.

148
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,663
I can't stop looking at it...?!

149
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,249
Wait... stop!

150
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,751
Come on! You're going too, Mika-san.

151
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,295
A storm is coming!

152
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,339
No, I gotta watch over the smoked meat!

153
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,216
Not like you can do anything here.

154
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,343
-S... stop I tell you!
-Come on!

155
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,344


156
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,389
I bet you just wanted to snitch food.

157
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,348


158
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,185
Come on, let's go. You help too, Mika.

159
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,145
Fine...

160
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,065
Don't pile it up.

161
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,734
Put it down and fix it.

162
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,152
Yes!

163
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,155
The clouds are starting to look pretty bad.

164
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,282
Jiro!

165
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,242
Maybe today is the day we finally see it!

166
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,827


167
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,496
See what?

168
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,997
Why does it matter?

169
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,709
It's fine, tell her about it.

170
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,169
The story of the glittering dragon.

171
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,420
Gibbs!

172
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:25,880


173
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,507
Glittering dragon?

174
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,634
What's the glittering dragon?

175
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,094


176
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:37,892
Once upon a time, a ship ran across a storm.

177
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,812
Dad, what happened to that ship?

178
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,608
Ah, the storm just got stronger
and stronger,

179
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:51,113
and everyone aboard came to terms
with the fact that they were done for.

180
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,281


181
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,786
Obstructed by thunderclouds,
and with their compass broken,

182
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,288
they couldn't tell south from north.

183
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,207
But in that moment,

184
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,126
between the clouds, they could see a light.

185
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,253
Lightning?

186
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,462
No, not that.

187
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:07,421
Eh?

188
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,382
Someone said

189
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:13,469
"This light comes from a town! 
We'll be saved!"

190
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,221
But something was weird.

191
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:22,562
That light was slowly approaching
the ship.

192
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:28,734
And what appeared before the crew members
holding their breath was...

193
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,154
A glittering dragon.

194
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,157
It was as if the ship was bewitched,

195
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,619
and it was drawn in to that dragon.

196
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,454
Who knows how much time passed...

197
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,584
but when they noticed, they had left
the storm behind.

198
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,043


199
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,837


200
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,298
The glittering dragon saved them!

201
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,716


202
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,970
It's just a legend.

203
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,681
Among the drakers,

204
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,559
there are a few of those superstitions
going around.

205
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,729
You know, before Jiro came to this ship,

206
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,607
he believed his dad's stories.


207
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,566
Right?

208
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,901
That happened a long time ago!

209
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,820
Why are you always bringing up things
from when I was a newbie...

210
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,324
When you're on a ship, there's nothing
but troubles!

211
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,201
I sure wish a dragon saved us!

212
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,953
Yeah, definitely.

213
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,414
If a dragon like that exists,
I'd love to see it.


214
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,960
No, it maybe does exist.

215
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,128
What?

216
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:32,840
After all, no one has ever seen
all the dragons.

217
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,259
If I ate a glittering dragon...

218
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,596
do you think my stomach would shine?

219
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,723
From the inside, like bam!

220
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,725
Hell if I know...

221
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,645
Guys, I don't see you working!

222
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,857
I'm going to keep watch.

223
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,615
The wind has gotten quite strong.

224
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,991
Should we change the course?

225
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,993
No, it's too late.

226
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,244


227
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,372
The clouds are growing too fast.

228
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,249
The storm already caught us.

229
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,671
Uh... everyone listen!

230
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,758
The weather has gotten rough!
The storm is coming!

231
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,135
Niko and Oken who are on duty, 
to the bridge,

232
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,304
Faye and Soraya go help the engine room,

233
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,807
everyone else stand by on your cabins.

234
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,600
Anything else, follow Gibbs' orders.

235
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,061
Old man!

236
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,147
You two check over there.

237
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,899
If it stops now, it'll fall apart!

238
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,234
Yes ma'am!

239
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,404
We're always so reckless...

240
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,490
I wish we had a more... safe sail...

241
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,449
I know right.

242
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,118
-Move your hands!
-Yes ma'am!

243
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,787
Good grief...

244
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,790
Everyone, put your safety belts on!

245
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,166
-Also, Capella!
-Yes!

246
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:50,960

247
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,338
Go to the toilet while you can.

248
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,881


249
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,800
Jiro, you don't need to 
keep watch anymore!

250
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,385
Get down here before you get blown away.

251
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,138
I can see the clouds better here 
than in the bridge!

252
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,349
If I don't predict the flow of the clouds,
we won't be able to get out of the storm.

253
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,809
I'll stay and keep at it!

254
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:07,893
But you know...

255
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:08,853

256
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,187
Mika!

257
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,941
Jiro, you have great eyes,
we're counting on you.

258
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,528
Switch with me. I'll be on the front,
you behind.

259
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,410
Mika...

260
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:25,828


261
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,330


262
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:29,915


263
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,335
Here.

264
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,589
Smoked salty salo, freshly made.

265
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:44,180
We're not in a picnic, you know?

266
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,057
You can't keep watch with 
an empty stomach.

267
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,691


268
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,286
It's coming.

269
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,580
Don't let the clouds at the front distract you!

270
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,081
Look at the flow!

271
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,500
We know!

272
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,877
A wall of clouds at 2 o'clock.

273
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,670
It goes all the way to the back.

274
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,715
Jiro, do you think we can 
pass through that side?

275
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:20,799
Hey!

276
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,676
Y-yeah...

277
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,261
It's probably fine.

278
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:25,513
Good.

279
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,264
Go over the clouds at 9 o'clock.

280
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,891
30 to port!

281
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,434
Go above the clouds.

282
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,560
Raise the tail!

283
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:32,686
Yes!

284
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,314
This goddamn storm...

285
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,316
The rudder feels so heavy!

286
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,361
Engine room! We're increasing the output!

287
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,447
-Ahh, come on!
-Check over there!

288
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:44,865
Yes!

289
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,075


290
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:47,952
Not both of you!

291
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,662
Right...!

292
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:50,621


293
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:56,752


294
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:07,805
Good...

295
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,390


296
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,351


297
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,855


298
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,192


299
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,611
The clouds on the front were hiding it...

300
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,034
No way...

301
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,619
Make the ship stand in the wind!

302
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,789
We can't! We're being swept away!

303
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,374


304
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,376


305
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:40,296
If we continue like this we won't
be able to escape!

306
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,549


307
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,727
Jiro, don't let it shake you off!

308
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,854
We've been surrounded...

309
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,898
We can't lift it anymore!

310
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,065
Can't we cut through the clouds?!

311
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,402
It's a vortex of air currents! 
We'd be torn to pieces!

312
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,654
The only option is to slip between the clouds.

313
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,656
-Right...
-For real?

314
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,033


315
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:09,992
That was close...

316
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,161


317
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:14,747


318
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,206


319
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,625
So close...

320
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,126
Takita, come here.

321
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,920
You should get away from the window.

322
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,212
Y-yes!

323
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:25,925


324
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,509


325
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,637
Vannie-san...

326
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,013
Oh?

327
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,098

328
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,059
What are you doing?

329
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,685
Do I stink?

330
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,770
Eh?

331
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,772
What are you saying at a time like this?

332
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,690


333
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,651

334
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,988
I wonder if Mika-san and Jiro-san are okay...

335
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:51,033
I just hope Jiro doesn't do anything reckless...

336
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,911
Jiro, how's it?

337
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,829
So far so good, keep going straight.

338
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,998
Don't change the course!

339
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,208


340
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,462


341
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,422


342
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,716


343
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,677
It's electrified?

344
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:10,886
This is...!

345
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,138
A chance we'll probably never have again,

346
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,892
being able to fly in the middle of this storm.

347
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:17,851
Eh?

348
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,521
The thunderclouds will bring us the dragon.

349
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:24,233
If it's going to appear,
it has to be under this sky.

350
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,862
Mika, let me sit at the front.

351
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,115
Being at the front all the time
wears you out.

352
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,075
What? I'm fine.

353
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,202
We don't know when will we able to
get out of this storm.

354
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,287


355
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,081


356
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,958


357
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,126


358
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,836


359
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:52,553


360
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,096


361
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,597

362
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,654


363
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:25,627
That light was slowly approaching
the ship.

364
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,802
And what appeared before the crew members
holding their breath was...

365
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,679
That was...

366
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,431
A glittering dragon.

367
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,485


368
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,986
Wow...

369
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,283


370
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,211
Guys, look towards port!

371
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,879
What, what?


372
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,214


373
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,757


374
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,258
This is...

375
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,594
Unbelievable...

376
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,429


377
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,139


378
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,563
Crocco!

379
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,357
Yeah, I'm seeing it.

380
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,650
Let's...

381
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,485
-Capture it!
-The hell?!

382
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,238
Are you insane?!
We're in the middle of a storm!

383
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,156
How do you plan to capture it?!

384
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,158
We better do it quick or it'll get away!

385
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,118
What are you talking about?!

386
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,328
-Just listen to me and 
bring the ship closer!
-As if I could!

387
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,287
Mika, move!

388
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:43,914
Crocco-san!

389
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,416
That dragon will show us the way.

390
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,586
If we follow it, we should be able
to get out of the storm!

391
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,463


392
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,423
Hey, hey, are you for real?

393
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,176
If the dragon is flying
avoiding the thunderclouds

394
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,678
it could be possible!

395
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,848
Sounds fun, I think we should trust him.

396
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,432
Deputy captain!

397
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,518
If we capture that dragon, we'd be rolling in it!

398
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,687
Agh! If it's not one it's the other!

399
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,443
Jiro, I leave this to you.

400
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,486
Wh- hey!

401
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:15,696
Mika!

402
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:16,989


403
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,393


404
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:50,564
Mika... were you really planning on 
catching it?

405
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:51,648


406
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:57,237
We were lucky we got to slip out
of the storm at all.

407
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,614


408
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:02,576
I can't believe I let such a big prey
escape from under my own nose...


409
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:06,496
It's fine, let the legend be a legend.

410
00:20:07,872 --> 00:20:10,167
Legends won't fill your stomach, you know?

411
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,543


412
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,590
Guys, the food is ready!

413
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,801
Oh! What do we have today?

414
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,263
Go on ahead.

415
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,434


416
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,769
Takita...

417
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,480
There's no meat in here...?

418
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,106
Eh?

419
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,692
There is though,

420
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:36,652
look.

421
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:38,487


422
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,864
You can't call this meat!

423
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,199
What do you want me to do?

424
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,284
That's what happens when we don't
catch dragons!

425
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,122
There's not much food left!

426
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,791
If you're gonna complain 
I'm taking it away!

427
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,750


428
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,336
Thanks for the food...

429
00:20:58,966 --> 00:20:59,800


430
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,392


431
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,734
Delicious.

432
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:27,077
