Ow!

5
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,307
I can't tell if we're in a draking vessel
or riding a wild horse...

6
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:42,644
I hope we don't bump into anything...

7
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,437
That's if we don't end up 
in pieces first...

8
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,396


9
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:49,776
You think Takita will be able
to reach this hell of a place?

10
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:53,655
We don't have any other place to search, 
we can only hope she's there.

11
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:56,449
We're reaching our limit here too!

12
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,702

19
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,761
We know already!

20
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,682
Attention, crew...

21
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,310
The 48 hours of emergency search
have come to an end.

22
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:25,979
Though it pains our heart...

23
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,858
all activities regarding the search
are suspended as of now.

24
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,984


25
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,360

29
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,331
We didn't savour that dragon yet.

00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,257
What's wrong?

34
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,012
Mika-san!!

35
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,514
Mika-saan!!

36
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,057


37
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,561
Bridge! Starboard and straight away!

38
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,896
At those pointy rocks!

39
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:09,772
Capella!

40
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,525
Right! Going full starboard!

41
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:13,651


42
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:16,988
Takita...

43
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,452
Is this for real?!

44
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,536
What?!

45
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,330
The wind has carried her voice here!

46
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,831
What do we do now?

47
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,584
We cannot remain static 
with this wind!

48
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,503
Move our right horizontal tail
as closer to the rocks as possible!

49
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,713


50
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,634
Vanabelle! Support the bridge
in my place!

51
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,636
Yes, leave it to me.

52
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,347


53
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,682
Move it slowly.

54
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,644
The altitude is fine, 
10 degrees to our right!

55
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,443
Miikaaa-saaan!!

Miiikaaa-saaan!!

00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:06,120
Miiikaaa-saaan!!

60
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,081
Takita!! Jump!!

61
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,123


62
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,336
Mika-san!

63
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,545

69
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,854
Takita... You were alive as I thought.

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,439


71
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,610
Luck's about the only thing
I have going for me.

72
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,239


73
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,159
Takita!!

74
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,536


75
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,289
Ascella-san!

76
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:53,293
Thank you very, very much
for taking care of me!!

77
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,379
I won't forget you

78
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,464
for as long as I live!

79
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:02,427
If you're that lucky, I'm sure
we will meet again!
 
80
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:09,851


81
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,146
So that was the famous "Mika-san"...

82
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:18,568
You're a draker, don't fall
off like that ever again!

83
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:19,986
Mmm?

84
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,905
By the way, that little thing
on your back...

85
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,157


86
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,199
Ah...

87
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,785
It's the cub of the dragon that
fell with me...

88
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,954
Eh...

89
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,540
I haven't tasted a dragon cub 
in my life!

90
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,584
Don't eat it!

91
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,127
Wai-!

92
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,879
Wipe off your drool!

93
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,464
Wai- The wind's spreading it 
at my fac-

94
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,965
Ew! So dirty...

95
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,509
Wait, Mika-san...! Ugh...

96
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,969
Takita...

97
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,431


98
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,390

99
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,850
Vannie-san!

100
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,018


101
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:52,977


102
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:56,481


103
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,609


104
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,947
I'm sorry I worried you...

105
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,785


106
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,163
Thank god.

107
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:16,375
It seems that this is the place
that "ferry" was aiming for.

108
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,462


109
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,799
Vannie-san, Mika-san,

110
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,426
can I count on you to help me
without asking any questions?

111
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,095
I'm returning this little one 
to the pod!

112
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,096


113
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,055
Wha?

114
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,433
Are you... the real Takita?

115
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,392


116
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,352


117
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,645
I know it already!

118
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,355
I smell bad! I'm aware of it!

119
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,399
So... you're the real deal.

120
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,567


121
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,987
Everyone, I'm sorry I worried you all!

122
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,115
It's me, Takita!

123
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,533
I'm home again!

124
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,826


125
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,328
It- It's her voice!

126
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,454
Takita!

127
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,832
Do you even know how many
problems have you caused to us all?!

128
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,251
Takita! I'm glad you were safe.

129
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:01,045
I believed she was alright
from the beginning!

130
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,171
Are you okay?!

131
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,381
Any wounds?!

132
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,966


133
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,717


134
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,303
As serious as ever, eh?

135
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,472
Just let it slide this one time, okay?

136
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,432


137
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:16,602
Yes...

138
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,063
I am... completely fine!

139
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,648
I'm so glad she's back!

140
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:21,941


141
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,985


142
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:27,196
I hope she isn't a ghost...

143
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,449
That girl...

144
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,576
is one hell of a girl alright!

145
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,827


146
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,622
This has been harder than 
chasing dragons!

147
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,458
You can say that.

148
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:40,877


149
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,004
I'm so glad she's fine...

150
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,380
Thank you, really.

151
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,381


152
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,134
But... I didn't specially...

153
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,719


154
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:50,678


155
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,096


156
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:54,891
The wind has calmed down.

157
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:55,850


158
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,102
Eh! They're gonna leaving this
one behind!

159
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,854
What should I do...?

160
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,105


161
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,441
Ah... right there!

162
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,445
It's a different dragon!

163
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,031
Ah! They're gonna hunt down
that pod!

164
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:10,990
Oh!

165
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,243
Dragons preying on each other!
What a rare sight!

166
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,203
Takita!

167
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,079
Tell everyone to follow
that dragon.

168
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,164
Eh?

169
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,540
If we do that, we will get closer
to that pod.

170
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,500


171
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,709
Crocco-san!

172
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,171
There's a different type of dragon 
that has appeared to hunt down that pod!

173
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,130
Ah?

174
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,009
That type...! It's a real rarity!

175
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,261
I'm sure they'd sell well.

176
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,348
Ah? You mean to hunt them?

177
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:38,142
We came here to do that
in the first place, right?

178
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,101


179
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,480
You heard it already! Let's do this!

180
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,065


181
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,360
You heard the bridge, guys!

182
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,321
Takita has come back and she brought
extra dragons with her!

183
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,573
We sure can't get bored with 
her around us!

184
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,451
You're damn right! What a
spunky girl!

185
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,870
I'm dead tired though...

186
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,123
We're leaving the emotional reunion
for after this!

187
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,875
One last work before the celebration!

188
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,168
Bring all your strenght and let's do this!

189
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,420
We're going to raise our altitude even more!

190
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,464
Engine room, how's things?
Can we bear it?

191
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,508
What? Are you serious?!

192
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,885
We've been forcing it pretty
bad already...

193
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,556
Besides that, you should be worrying
about the hull more than the engine.

194
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,141
Ahh? As long as we don't bump into
anything we'll be fine!

195
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,268
Eh?!!

196
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,979
Crocco-san! Don't speak as if this
hasn't anything to do with you!

197
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,690
We're running out of oxygen
and the engine is knocking nonstop!

198
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,234
Then we should change the fuel.

199
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,277
Hiro, hurry up!

200
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:33,114
Ah... she's treating us like slaves...

201
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,117
We're entering the clouds!
All hands on deck!

202
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,243
Yes, sir!

203
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,578
I'll be on port side!

204
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,162
Okay, we'll be on starboard then!

205
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,455
Understood!

206
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,916
We have poor visibility,
be careful!

207
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,627


208
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,587
Takita!

209
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,713
Jiro-san!

210
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,426
Takita, you're hurt, aren't you?!

211
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,468
Don't be wandering around here!

212
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,428


213
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,430
If you were to fall again, then what?!

214
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,181
Go inside and rest.

215
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,434


216
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,019
Y-yes!

217
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,318
Amazing...

218
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:13,154
Dragons... attacking other dragons.

219
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,489
Gibbs...

220
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,449
Mika!

221
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,367
Those dragons are focused on the pod.

222
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,910
The moment they have their jaws
busy, shoot them.

223
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:20,953
I know that!

224
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,624


225
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,059
Nice!

226
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,586


227
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,545


228
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,468
Uwah! What's with this number?!

229
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,761
Where are they coming from?!

230
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,888
They seem like moths
gathering at a light.

231
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:42,058
So this is the so called 
dragon corridor...

232
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,018
I cannot believe my eyes!

233
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,978
Hey, are you kidding?

234
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,438
If something like this exists...

235
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:51,150
Why do we have to fly around the
world searching for them?!

236
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,234
Yeah...

237
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,863
But a dragon corridor is
a very strange phenomenon.

238
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:59,659
You can only see one every few years
and they always appear suddenly.

239
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,620
You can't predict something like that, right?

240
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,456
Soraya, I think you should study
even if it's only a little.

241
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,041


242
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:11,045
When the smoke blows, 
dragons will pass by...

243
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,298
So that's what it means.

244
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,800


245
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,719
With this situation, I can't even
think of a way to return this little one!

246
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,888


247
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,348


248
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,350


249
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,310
Sorry, sorry...

250
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,520
He- hey!

251
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,398


252
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,607


253
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:36,278
Now we're alone, you and I, eh?!

254
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,322


255
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,159
Hurry up with that anchor!
Keep moving!

256
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,744
We're finished here!

257
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,955
Good! Let's hurry up and go back!

258
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,914


259
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,125
Hey, over there... something is coming!

260
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,007


261
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,469
Tha- that's stupidly big...!

262
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,346
I haven't seen one like that in my life!

263
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,099
The group that is anchoring, hurry up
and get them back in the ship now!

264
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,517
It's coming this way!

265
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,227


266
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,940
Full starboard, hurry!

267
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,610


268
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,070


269
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,739
Jaw dropping...

270
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:24,952
I guess it saw this feast going on and
came down from the upper layers.

271
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,203
Bridge!

272
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,580
Yes, we understand!

273
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,331
I'll take on the elevator!

274
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,542
We're retreating away from this place, now!

275
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,044
There's a strong wind blowing towards north!

276
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,921
I'll go around and 
ride the airflow!

277
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:38,716


278
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,351
Ah! That's...

279
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,437
Coming at us...

280
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,481
It's riding the same wind!

281
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,900
Mika-san! What happened?

282
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,694
There's a huge dragon that 
none of us have seen before!

283
00:12:58,819 --> 00:12:59,987
I'm gonna hunt it!

284
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,739
Ah, Mika-san!

285
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:02,698
Ow...

286
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:03,657


287
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:06,827
Everyone on the ship yet?
We're retreating!

288
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,497


289
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,707
-Takita.
-Vannie-san.

290
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,626
If you're a draker too...

291
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,585
Eh?

292
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,755
Do your duty as one of us!

293
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:18,756


294
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:19,924
And what will you do, Vannie-san?

295
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,800
I can't leave that idiot alone!

296
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,679
Oh... what the hell are you doing?!

297
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,473
Hey, wait! Hey!

298
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,391
Come with me!

299
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,769


300
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,979
Damn it...

301
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,273
What a day...

302
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,359
Hiro-san, I've been looking for you!

303
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,318
Eh?

304
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,487
Is the autogyro able to fly now?

305
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,030
Huh?

306
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,366
What are you saying all of a sudden...?

307
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,535
Please, I beg you!

308
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,662
Eh? Ah...

309
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,038


310
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,999
But... you see...

311
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:54,959


312
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,712
I have to return this little one
no matter what!

313
00:13:58,879 --> 00:13:59,713


314
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:01,966

315
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,593


316
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:08,389
I'll prepare the high altitude fuel for you...

317
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,348


318
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,225
But, whatever happens...

319
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,311
Ah, what are you doing?
It's dangerous out here!

320
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,479


321
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,439


322
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,440
Eh?

323
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,068


324
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,280


325
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,782
I'm launching you for real!
Are you really sure?!

326
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,742
Yes, no problem!

327
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,078
Huh? I see a lot of problems with this!

328
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:35,499
Damnit... Why are you always 
causing issues, Takita?!

329
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,545
This fuel sometimes gets air into the motor
so it can be a bit difficult to accelerate.

330
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,922
Eh? Ah... okay.

331
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,633
Don't you dare... fall off!

332
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,801
Ye-...

333
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,386
Yes!

334
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,430


335
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,390
There you go!

336
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,766


337
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,728
Hey! Don't shake it like that!

338
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,146


339
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,983
Well... let's get back to work!

340
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,736
Listen... what's that?

341
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,572
Ah! What the hell are they doing?!

342
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,531


343
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,659


344
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,078
Ah, Jiro-san! Over there!

345
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,956
Damnit... Why am I doing this?

346
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,171


347
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,339


348
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,799


349
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,051


350
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,510


351
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,347



352
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,724
Ah... Vanabelle!

353
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,809
What do you think you're doing, 
goddamnit?!

354
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,355
You're hunting it, aren't you?

355
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:40,522


356
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,233
Yeah, it'll be so tasty...

357
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,402


358
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,946


359
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,115


360
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,335
Takita, why are you doing this?

361
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:05,005
Because I'm... I'm a draker.

362
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,298
Huh?!

363
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:10,469
I killed this little one's mother
and ate it.

364
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:14,098
You're a draker, of course you'd do that.

365
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,140
Yes.

366
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,395
We're... a dragon and a draker.

367
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,354
Huh?

368
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,565
That's why I have to return
this little one to its pod...

369
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,359
so it can become a full-fledged dragon!

370
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,528
Full-fledged?

371
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,781
What are you saying...?

372
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,825
I don't get you.

373
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,160
I want...

374
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,163
I also want to live in the sky.

375
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,331


376
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,754


377
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,176
I think... I got it.

378
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,726


379
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,852


380
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,895


381
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:02,896


382
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,400
You... you said to charge it with
extra power after all...

383
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,609
We kinda overdid it...

384
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,069
But that explosion was the best, right?!

385
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,195


386
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,035


387
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,412


388
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:20,956


389
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:23,667
Niko!

390
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:24,918


391
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,379
By a hair's breadth...

392
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,381
With this, my debt is settled.

393
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,718
Takita! Go!!

394
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,770
The next time we see each other...

395
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,314
I'm definetely going to hunt you.

396
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,567
Because I'm a draker after all.

397
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,360


398
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,989
That's why... till then...

399
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,784
Don't let anyone eat you, okay?

400
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,577
You'll be fine.

401
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:03,499
Here we go!

402
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,225


403
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:29,566


404
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,277


405
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:33,946


406
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,967


407
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,219


408
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,226


409
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,645


410
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,481
'Sup.

411
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,985
Takita! Jiro!

412
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,945
What the hell were you thinking
to do this now of all times?!

413
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,865
Hiro, you too!

414
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,283


415
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,534
And you too, Mika!

416
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,702
You're always like this...

417
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,620
-Worrying all of us...
-In the end

418
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,039
-Think about what you're doing for once!
-I missed the last shot...

419
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,040


420
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,542


421
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,169


422
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,462


423
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,214
The sunrise...

424
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,094
We can barely see the pod now...

425
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,429
Yeah.

426
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:41,722


427
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,432
Mika-san

428
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:48,020
The sky is so big and wide.

429
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,354
Ah?

430
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,068
Hey, guys!

431
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,821
You seem alright!
You must be hungry, right?

432
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,115
Hurry up inside, I'm gonna prep
breakfast soon!

433
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,283


434
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,619
One steak for me!

435
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,288
But it's early in the morning.

436
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,374
When you pull an all nighter, 
no one cares about that!

437
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,126
Then, the same goes for booze.

438
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,337
Takita's back and all!

439
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,130
We gotta celebrate!!

440
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,215


441
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:21,261
I should've taken a bite off of that
one when I got the chance...

442
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,221
Hey...

443
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,472


444
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,307


445
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,934
Don't laugh at me! Please!

446
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,310
Geez!

447
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:36,360
Chasing dragons that swim through the sky,
To the west, east, south and north.

448
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,447
Catching the wind, seizing the shadows,

449
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,784
our journey goes on.

450
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,827
Hey, Takita! Bring the explosives!

451
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:46,787
Right away!

452
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,332
Takita, what are you doing?
Bring here the bomb lances!

453
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,375
Coming!

454
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,586


455
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:55,545


456
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:56,880


457
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,924
It looks delicious... Right?

458
00:20:59,049 --> 00:20:59,883


459
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,426
Yeah...

460
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,511


461
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,137
Please, be careful!

462
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:05,639


463
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,557


464
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,602
Hey, Takita! Come here!

465
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,145
Ah, coming!

466
