1
00:00:01,876 --> 00:00:05,714
The crew aboard the Quin Zaza
is very diverse.

2
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:10,677
People who wanted to be in a ship.
People who are on board for certain reasons…

3
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:11,928
Their origins being different

4
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:16,975
with their own circumstances.
Everyone here became a draker.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,060
Ah! This is...!

6
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,896
Hey-... Hey!
Everyone, there's an emergency!

7
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:22,856
Mm?

8
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,483
Like I said, there's an emergency.

9
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,861
This... this is...!

10
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,196
Vanabelle... right?

11
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,782
Wow... It's as if someone drew it 
while watching her.

12
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:33,742
Totally.

13
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,245
There's no way that it'd look that good
without seeing her in the flesh!

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,913
Does that mean he saw her like this?

15
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,749
-Nah, there's no way.
-But man...

16
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:44,002
Either way, this is pretty good…

17
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:44,961
Ah!

18
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,964
Yeah, not bad at all.
In fact, this is great!

19
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,299
Hey, let me look too!

20
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,258
Ah!

21
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,343
Hey! Stop that!

22
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,386
Let us look at it some more!

23
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:54,345
Yeah!

24
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,638
It's not as it would wither or anything!

25
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,682
-Denied!
-Eh...

26
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:58,933


27
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,896
But I wonder who on earth would draw this...

28
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,318


29
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,946
"Catching the wind, seizing the shadows."

30
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,534
So... where are we supposed to go?

31
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:23,625
♪〜

32
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,166
〜♪

33
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,918
Well, Oken...

34
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,504
With this as a proof...
Can we establish

35
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,798
that there's someone spying on 
Vanabelle while she sleeps?

36
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,342
Yeah, there's no other believable option.

37
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,971
We have even 4 women aboard,
which is pretty rare.

38
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,973
I believe that this lucky-

39
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:02,932


40
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:06,060
I-I mean, this serious situation
would happen sooner or later!

41
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:08,187
Either way, who would have thought

42
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,481
that there's someone
so brave as to do that to Vannie!

43
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,318
The room where the drawing was found was...

44
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:17,196
Jiro, Hiro and Gaga's room.

45
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,824
The culprit is one of those three.

46
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,326
Now this has gotten interesting!

47
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,285
Eh?

48
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,203
Nah, nevermind.

49
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,916
I don't think Jiro-san
would be capable of something like that.

50
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:32,337
Nope! Sometimes the most 
straight-laced ones are the worst!

51
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,924
The engineer's apprentice, Hiro, has
pretty skillful hands too...

52
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,384
Yeah, and he's pretty gloomy,
it could be him.

53
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,220
And Gaga is...

54
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,554


55
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,182
Do you think someone with those looks
would be able to draw?

56
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:48,228
Well, with those ones as our culprits
it will be pretty easy to find the culprit.

57
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,439
Ooh! How shameful!

58
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,441
So? What are we gonna do?

59
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:54,651


60
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,069
Yeah, let me see...

61
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,155
First, we get the suspects and...

62
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,742


63
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,703
I see!

64
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,041
Hey, Hiro!

65
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,125
Come here a sec...

66
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,752


67
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,921
Um... Jiro-san!

68
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:15,880


69
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,466
Can you draw a portrait of me?

70
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,051
What?

71
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,762
It is settled.

72
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,472
Yeah.

73
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,316


74
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,820
The culprit behind this drawing of Vanabelle

75
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,405
it's you, Gaga!

76
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,991
Ah... Wha-!
What are you taking without permission?

77
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,077
To think that you sneaked into the 
room of a sleeping beauty...

78
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,537
What a sly bastard.

79
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,956
Huh? What are you talking about?!

80
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,792
Being a bad loser is kinda lame!

81
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,127
Go on, confess your crimes!

82
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,212
Are you the one who drew Vannie-san's portrait?

83
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,631
It's a misun-... misunderstanding!

84
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,092
L-Let go of me!

85
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,468
That hurts!

86
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,555
If you are so worked up about it
it makes you all the more suspicious!

87
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,223


88
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,182


89
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,601
Ow...

90
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,478


91
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,438


92
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,691
I see you are as close as ever...

93
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,110
You see, I can't sleep over here.

94
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,487
And you are quarreling about
something irrelevant again!

95
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,864


96
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,449
Bo-boss...

97
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,451


98
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:31,122
Wow... I had no idea!

99
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,083
That you were so good at drawing, Gaga-san!

100
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,210
I'm drawing these as a journal of things 
that happen in the ship.

101
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,004
Oh! There's a drawing of me!

102
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,214
Are you really able to draw this 
only from your imagination?

103
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:43,092
Yes, I think it's pretty normal...

104
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:46,262
So that means that you weren't peeping at all.

105
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,431
I'm glad.

106
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,933
Why were you keeping this from all of us?

107
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,311
That... that is because...

108
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:57,940
Hey, how about you draw me 
a nice nude of my type of woman?

109
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,859
Ah, Gaga, one for me too!

110
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,903
I didn't say anything about it

111
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,321
precisely because of this.


112
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,406
Well! From the very beginning I believed

113
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,201
that you, Gaga, wouldn't be 
capable of something so low!

114
00:06:08,626 --> 00:06:09,160
Huh?

115
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,079
You suspected him the most!

116
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,163


117
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,539
Oken-san...

118
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:17,585
With all said and done, I'm glad there isn't
a bad person aboard the ship.

119
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,544


120
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:19,504
Yeah!

121
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,755


122
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,340


123
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,926
Guys...

124
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,260


125
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:30,181
Since you are 
so energetic and gung-ho...

126
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,892
I will pick a special job for all of you.

127
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,268


128
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,770
Put your back into it!

129
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,729

130
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:40,817
Originally, Takita, you were the one
who jumped to the wrong conclusions!

131
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,236
Niko-san, weren't you also on board
with the idea from minute one?

132
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,239
When we finish this I'm gonna
have my arms stiff for 2 days straight.

133
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,449
To think that I was off duty today...

134
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,409
My hips hurts so bad!

135
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,370
It will be filthy in no time again anyway!

136
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,788
Why am I doing this too?

137
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,747
Hey!

138
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,415
If you have time for small talk
move those hands instead!

139
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,458
Yes, sir!

140
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,461
If you are so easy on the floor
we are gonna be here till the end of time!

141
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,213
What is this ruckus?

142
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,172
Who knows...

143
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,091
Ah, Vannie-san!

144
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,884
It's... it's nothing.

145
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,261


146
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,518


147
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,645


148
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,107


149
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,401


150
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,653
My hair is unruly as ever...

151
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,197
Doing it by force will make it worse.

152
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,241
Ah, Vannie-san.

153
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,161
Th-thank you very much.

154
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,414


155
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,000
Do you mind dandruff...?

156
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,085
We're all the same inside this ship.

157
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:42,336


158
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,341
Mmm? What a good smell!

159
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,968
What is that?

160
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,178
It's perfumed oil.

161
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,514
You get this by mixing camellias and dragon incense.

162
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,765
Dragon incense?

163
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:58,895
It's the mineral obtained from rare secretions 
that form inside a dragon's body.

164
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,105
Listen, Takita...

165
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:02,732
What do you think of this ship?

166
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,859
Eh? Ah, yeah...

167
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,986
I'm completely accustomed to it now! 

168
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:11,407
I'm the type that can sleep anywhere
as long as there's a roof over my head!

169
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:15,786
I... sometimes feel a bit lost.

170
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,207
I wonder why am I here right now...

171
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,252
And going so far as to kill dragons...

172
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:27,423
So you do have times of doubt too,
Vannie-san.

173
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,634
You thought I was more aloof?

174
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,469
Ah... no, it's not like that!

175
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,721
Vannie-san, you always have
this cool aura around you.

176
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,641
And your skill catching dragons
is second to no one aboard!

177
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:40,895
It's not like that... 
I just had nowhere to belong to on land. 

178
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,939
Nowhere to belong to?

179
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,150
Since I had no place for me to belong to

180
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,444
I became skilled in how to fly.

181
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,695
And that's all.

182
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,489
Ah...

183
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,451
Sorry for letting out something so awkward.

184
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,537
Ah, nevermind.

185
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,164


186
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,505


187
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:09,674
Ah?

188
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,050


189
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,390
You are always eating bread like that.

190
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,351
I like the way
it soaks in the soup. 

191
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,937
U-Um! 
We have pickled cabbage!

192
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,356
Don't go only eating
stew and potatoes!

193
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,858
Mika-san! Pass me your plate.

194
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,068
Eh...?

195
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,654
That is so pickled that is 
sure to be sour.

196
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,198
It's so fermented precisely
because nobody's eating it!

197
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,993
Takita, I'm committed...

198
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,911
Committed to eat only the
things I like...

199
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,247
Shut up and pass me your plate, please.

200
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,623


201
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,916
Ah! Vannie-san.

202
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:44,875


203
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,794
Make space for her there.

204
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,713
-No need to mind yourself with that.
-Eh?

205
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:49,797
Takita!

206
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,925
I left the laundry for you in front
of the boys' quarters.

207
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,470
Eh...? You could do that much
by yourself!

208
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,764
All chores are for the newbies after all.

209
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,059
You left laundry
to do not so much ago!

210
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,019


211
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,067
Hey, Gaga.

212
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,571
You were cleaning the deck
the other day, right?

213
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,697
-What's with that?
-Eh...

214
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,992
Oh... that, yeah.
There's no particular reason...

215
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,036
-My drawings were...
-Drawings?

216
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,829
No... I mean...

217
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,958
Wai-...! Mika-san!

218
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,170
If you are that rough with it
it's gonna end up breaking!

219
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,798
If you don't do this much
it doesn't feel like you've actually done it.

220
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,425
Nooo way!

221
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,053
Let go of the lever, please!

222
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,095


223
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,641
I'm astonished at the passion 
you put into doing laundry.

224
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,768
Oh, Vannie-san!

225
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,937
Mika-san is doing this
by brute force!

226
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,022
Let me do it.

227
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,900
I just wanted to help...

228
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:54,820


229
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,280
-What?
-Nothing...

230
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,158
Mika-san, hang out these instead!

231
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,242
Okay... 

232
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,161
By the way, Mika-san...

233
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,205
Didn't you... notice something?

234
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,164
Mmm?

235
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,499
I mean...

236
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,002
Like a good smell coming out or something...

237
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,671
Yeah, a smell clear as day...

238
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:13,631
Eh!

239
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,800
A very delicious smell...

240
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:16,759
Oh?

241
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:17,968
A dragon!

242
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:20,971
Where... where is it?

243
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,306
It's hidden in the clouds.

244
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,058
I'm going to the lookout to check!

245
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,267
Ah...! Mika-san!

246
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,310


247
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:27,812


248
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,730
We are going out too.

249
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:30,689


250
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,484
Nope! We can't see anything from here yet!

251
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,319
You sure it wasn't the shadow of a cloud?

252
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,821
To our 8 o'clock.

253
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,114
It's probably hidden in the clou-

254
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,032
Oh, hey! Mika, wai-!

255
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:40,991
Crocco!

256
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,911
There's a mountain of clouds to our 8.
It's behind that!

257
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,329
Do us a favour and raise the ship!

258
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,124
Show some respect
to your deputy captain!

259
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,333


260
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,585
He wasn't on the morning shift, was he?

261
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,629
Give us a break and behave!

262
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,423


263
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,426
Mika!
Don't go doing whatever you want!

264
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,844


265
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,179
Hey! Are you listening to me, Mika?

266
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,305


267
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,849
So little space...

268
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,392
Oh!

269
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,399
It looks quite big.

270
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,610
It's the first time I see a dragon so round.

271
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,028
It looks delicious.

272
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:18,988
Eh?

273
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,198
Ohh! It's pretty huge!

274
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,075
What a strange form...

275
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,618
Okay! All hands on deck! Prepare!

276
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,415
Hurry up!
The dragon waits for no one!

277
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,338


278
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:37,965


279
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,426
Good one!

280
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,345
As one would expect from you, Gibbs,
you don't miss!

281
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,389


282
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,684
What is it doing?

283
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,189
It is... looking at us.

284
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,233


285
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,737


286
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,072
Wha- What is this?!

287
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,657


288
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,201


289
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,410


290
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:07,870


291
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:13,250


292
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,753


293
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,088
Are you alright?

294
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,216


295
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,884


296
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,638
What... was that?

297
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,349


298
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,643
Argh... I'm so dizzy...

299
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,353
Here you go, water.

300
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,855
Ugh... ah, thank you.

301
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,691
What the hell was that?

302
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,235
It was a sound.

303
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,362
It was attacking us with that soundwave.

304
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,448
You mean it wasn't attacking the ship but us?

305
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,368
We won't be able to aim our bomb lances like that.

306
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,955
If this continues, it seems that waiting 
for it to grow weaker is the better choice.

307
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,456
Are you listening?

308
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,541
Mmm?

309
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,876
Do you think

310
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,087
we can just wait for it to die like that
for hours on end?

311
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,838
I'm going out to finish it off!

312
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:00,798
And what are you planning to do?

313
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,884
As long as we have it anchored
it is not a matter if we can stand on it or not!

314
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,219
Don't be stupid!

315
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,137
It's impossible, it'll explode your eardrums!

316
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,781
And we are trying to take its life!

317
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:09,640
Mika!

318
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,436
Do you have that much fun killing dragons?

319
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,289


320
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,833


321
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,209


322
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,380
Ugh... he is so reckless as ever...

323
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,882


324
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,884


325
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,094
Tell the bridge to
raise our course!

326
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:50,764
Heh...

327
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,688


328
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,232

329
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,735


330
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,987


331
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,573


332
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,367


333
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,621

334
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,583


335
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:22,588
It's like... the sky is spinning...

336
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,965


337
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,928


338
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:30,638


339
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,974


340
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,852

341
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,979


342
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,397


343
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,944


344
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,236


345
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:47,863


346
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,866
Still screaming, huh?

347
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:54,286
My head is spinning like crazy...

348
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,412
Get a grip on yourself!

349
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,413
Ah...

350
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,250
Vanabelle...

351
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,212


352
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,505
Are you okay?

353
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,633
Leave me alone! Finish it off!

354
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:08,592

355
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,972
Quick... put it out of its misery...

356
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,223


357
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:21,897


358
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:23,482
Vannie-san!

359
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:32,157
I... sometimes feel a bit lost.

360
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,869
I wonder why am I here right now...

361
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,707
And going so far as to kill dragons...

362
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:44,795
So you do have times of doubt too,
Vannie-san.

363
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:49,925
Since I had nowhere to belong to on land,
I became skilled in how to fly.

364
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,138
Since I had no place for me to 
belong to on land...

365
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,019
That's... all there is to it!

366
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,020


367
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,067
It has shrunk quite noticeably...

368
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,986
Great work out there! Are you alright?

369
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,948
Gibbs... I'm participating in the dissection too...

370
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,700
You can't even walk straight.

371
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,953
Good grief...
You're always so careless...

372
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,496


373
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,456


374
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,543
Even if you managed to catch it,
there's no point if you die out there!

375
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,378
I won't die.

376
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:30,966
I can't allow myself to die,
not until I have savored all of you.

377
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,596
Hunt, dissect and eat.

378
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,432
That's what all drakers are about.

379
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,059


380
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,524
Return peacefully to the clouds
and grant us good winds.

381
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:48,484


382
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,235
Words for parting.

383
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,528
Eh...

384
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,113
Ah! Mika-san!

385
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,616
Oh, come on! Stay put!

386
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,789
Oh, I found a big rat.

387
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,999
Oh? Ah, it's you Vanabelle.

388
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,834
I'm not snitching food, okay?

389
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,378
Isn't your shift over?

390
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:09,880
I couldn't sleep, that's all.

391
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,757
What's that?

392
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:16,345
It's the liver of the dragon we captured today.
I put it in the oiling pot along with its fat.

393
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,722
And secretly cooked it 
at a low temperature.

394
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:19,681


395
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,601
And you don't call that snitching food?

396
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,978
Do you mind accompanying me for a glass?

397
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,482
I see we have some leftovers of 
potato and cabbage.

398
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,819
Can you smash these together with a little bit
of oil and salt?

399
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,153
What are we going to make?

400
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,988
Simple countryside cooking.

401
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:39,284
Spread the pickled cabbage
on a mold coated with oil.

402
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:42,955
And then press together
liver confit with mashed potatoes.

403
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,041
-Mika.
-Mmm?

404
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:50,212
When you are hunting dragons
you are always smiling.

405
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,631
It is so much fun?

406
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,966
I wonder.

407
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,177
But... I guess it is fun.

408
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,054
I see...

409
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,639
Yeah...

410
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:05,602
Then, you press together the ingredients
inside the mold...

411
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:10,107
And then you remove it with care, 
cut it in your desired sized pieces and it's done.

412
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,066
Ohh!!

413
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,068
Will you look at that beauty!

414
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,863

415
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,447


416
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,700
Yeah! It's so good!

417
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,911
Vanabelle, this is great!

418
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:26,081
It's strong, rich and fresh at the same time!

419
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:29,334
It seems like we randomly put this together
but it tastes like proper cooking!

420
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,795
Oh? What are you eating there?

421
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,589
It's not as if I was snitching food!

422
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,215
It's something that Vanabelle made.

423
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,259
I was not asking you that.

424
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,218
Back from your shift?

425
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,387
Yeah, I'm freezing all over.

426
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,805
Now's our turn to work.

427
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,057
Both of you here and alone?

428
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,809
-What a rare sight.
-Indeed.

429
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:48,187
This looks good, don't mind if I do...

430
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,313
Ah! Wai-!

431
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,149
Yeah! This is great!

432
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,859
Eh? Well, if it's so good...

433
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,111
Ahh! Those were all for me...

434
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,946
Mmm... it's delicious!

435
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,449
Vannie!
Please make this again some other time!

436
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,160
Yeah... if you are happy with something like that.

437
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:04,786
Here you go.

438
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,497
Ah! Thanks for the food!

439
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,333
Listen, Mika.

440
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,502
Why are you here?
On this ship?

441
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,880
Isn't it obvious?

442
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,965
It's because I love dragons.

443
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:18,759


444
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:22,596
Hunting dragons, dissecting them
and eating them...

445
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,806
And the way we all live here.

446
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,184

447
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:31,980
But above all else, it's because 
I get to eat a lot of dragons here.

448
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,190


449
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,068
If you want something good, 
there are many other tasty things out there.

450
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,530
But dragons are the most delicious of all.

451
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,202


452
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,414


453
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,335


454
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,338
Ugh...

455
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:57,756
So cruel!

456
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,508
Jiro-san told me!

457
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,386
You were all eating
something tasty yesterday!

458
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,387
Ah?

459
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,721
You're so unfair!

460
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,057
Can you not yell next to my ear?

461
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,141
Unfair! Unfair!

462
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,477
Why didn't you wake me up?

463
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,854
Ah, Jiro-san, this goes for you too!

464
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,898
All of you excluding me...

465
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,692


466
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,862
Vannie-san, don't laugh
and tell them off too!

467
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:27,119
