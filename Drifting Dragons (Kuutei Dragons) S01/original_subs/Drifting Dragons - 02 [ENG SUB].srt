1
00:00:01,543 --> 00:00:03,044
Right now, I'm working hard

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:06,548
to become a full-fledged draker.

3
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:10,593
I need to learn a lot of 
new things every day, though...

4
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:12,762
Close your arms more.

5
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,973
Okay, focus.

6
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,933
You don't need to hold your breath.

7
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:18,268


8
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:21,229


9
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,816
Yes, that's good.

10
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,861
I can't let you shoot real bullets just yet,

11
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,612
but keep practicing every day.

12
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:30,780
Yes!

13
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:37,996
It's coming!

14
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:40,790
Fire!!

15
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,125


16
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,043
Yes, on point!

17
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:47,046


18
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,800


19
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:51,843


20
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,940
It seems we don't need more, right?

21
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:09,986
Yeah. Well, aren't you starting to
look the part!

22
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,864
I can't be a newbie forever!

23
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:13,948
Nah,

24
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,241
you still have a long way to go.

25
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,618


26
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,162
Ah... Mika-san?

27
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,705
Takita.

28
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,249
Tell the bridge to bring the ship closer.

29
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,834


30
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,462
We'll get good oil from this one.

31
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,421
Probably.

32
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:31,174
Please don't jump on it again, okay?!

33
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,884
Ahh!!

34
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,011


35
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,221
Geez!

36
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,306


37
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,979
Man, why does he always...

38
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,775
Draking vessel, Quin Zaza.

39
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:53,321
This is the place I belong to now.

40
00:01:54,614 --> 00:02:00,620
♪〜

41
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:23,202
〜♪

42
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,874


43
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,376


44
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,879
Jiro, can you fit some more there?

45
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,340
Yeah, it's fine.

46
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,716
Come over here too.

47
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:37,675
Yes!

48
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,180
So hot...

49
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,766
Just a bit more!

50
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,643
-Tired?
-Eh?

51
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:47,936
Of course we are!

52
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,606
We've been extracting oil for 
48 hours straight!

53
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,066
I'm dead tired...

54
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:57,028
It's hot, smelly and we're covered in soot!

55
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,489
Takita, what a place you've ended up in!

56
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,783
You bet...

57
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,202
But you always look like you're having fun.

58
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,161

59
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,789
Oh, to be young...

60
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:08,873
Eh?

61
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,043
We'll arrive to a big town in a bit.

62
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,213
When we deliver all this oil to the
refinery company over there

63
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,215
we'll be able to relax for a while.

64
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,424
One last effort!

65
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,968
Yeeeeah...

66
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,970


67
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,431
If we sell all this, 
how much will it be?

68
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,017
We got a lot of good oil this time, so...

69
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,602
Gibbs-san, excuse me...

70
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,396
Oh, Lee-san.

71
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,147
How much do you think it will be?

72
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,857
Eh? Ah...

73
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,651


74
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,362


75
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:42,865
Are dragons that valuable?!

76
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:46,494
"One dragon makes seven towns flourish",
they say.

77
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,996
Meat and oil go without saying,

78
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,581
but depending on the species, the bones
can become craft products,

79
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,500
and entrails can be materials for medicines.

80
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,711
Dragons are mountains of treasures.

81
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:55,670


82
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:56,838
And on the other hand,

83
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,882
the loss when we fail to capture one
is huge, too.

84
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,051
Draking vessels are a money hole.

85
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,970
Actually, even with this, we're in the red.

86
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,346
U-um...

87
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:10,476
By the way, how much would...
my compensation be...?

88
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,395
Hmm, let's see...

89
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,064


90
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,149


91
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,650


92
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,612
Only... that...

93
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,700
Takita-san, since you still owe your entrance
pay to the ship,

94
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,160
that's what's being substracted.

95
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,037


96
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,997
You have it hard too, huh.

97
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,624
I know it's obvious, but was there
still that much left?

98
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,002
I gotta work hard to pay it off!

99
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,005
Takita, give me some oil cake.

100
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:39,964


101
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,341
What are you going to do with that?

102
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,262
If you dry and dehidratate it,
you can get some good broth from it.

103
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,806
And you can simply boil it and
eat it like that.

104
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,058
Ah?

105
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,436
You have it hard too, Mika-san...

106
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,479


107
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:58,816


108
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,569
The wind feels so good!

109
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,863


110
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:04,822


111
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,366
Is that a passenger ship?

112
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,744
The town must be close...

113
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,537


114
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,456


115
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,500
It sure gets cold really fast outside!

116
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,459
Eh?

117
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:18,211


118
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,755
That scared me! A bird?

119
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,425
No, birds shouldn't fly this high...

120
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,677


121
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,013


122
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,139
Eh?

123
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,017
Don't tell me... it's...

124
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,520
Could this be a...?

125
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,563
Wait!

126
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,107


127
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,109


128
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,568


129
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,363


130
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:50,159
Ahhh... we're finally done.

131
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,370
Today was so hard...

132
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,497
-Yeah...
-I'm so tired!

133
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,125
Hey, what are you gonna do when we land?

134
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,543
Goes without saying!

135
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,253
Booze, of course!

136
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,381
The sky has dragons! The land has booze!

137
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,716


138
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:06,676
Ah!

139
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,219
Guys! A small one has sneaked 
into the ship...

140
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,680
What? Takita, leave it for later.

141
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,223
We're worn out...

142
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,725
Yeah, yeah! You rest too, Takita.

143
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,103
Eh? Um... Wait!

144
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,021


145
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:25,736
Okay!

146
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,364
Dragons are a mountain of treasures!

147
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,787


148
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:35,913
Hey, Takita.

149
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:37,957
Hmm?

150
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,543
What is she doing?

151
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,297


152
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,175


153
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,095


154
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:52,763


155
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,727


156
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:01,939


157
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,524


158
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,567


159
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:06,986


160
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:11,657


161
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,744


162
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,623


163
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,708


164
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,045


165
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,300
Where did it go...?

166
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,053
What are you doing?

167
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,138
Ah, no, this is nothing...

168
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,516
More importantly, why are you
following me?

169
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,267
No particular reason...

170
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,019


171
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,106
Mika-san, are you snitching food again?

172
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:46,651
Indeed.

173
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,653
"Indeed" you say...

174
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,280

175
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,534


176
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,536


177
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,163


178
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,461
Gibbs-san!

179
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,881
Look at this bite.

180
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,510
You were attacked? What bit you?

181
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,554
It wasn't a mouse, that's for sure.

182
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,138
It was bigger.

183
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,640
Like a dog or a cat?

184
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,976
No, it was something different.

185
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,645
I heard Gibbs collapsed!
What happened?

186
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,147
Apparently he got bit by something weird
and collapsed.

187
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,275
Something weird? Like what?

188
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,819
Hm? Takita?

189
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,028


190
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,405
U-um...

191
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,325
That could be...

192
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,663
You haven't found it yet?!

193
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:41,622
I'm so sorry!

194
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,417
We are searching everywhere 
on the ship but...

195
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,752
Damn it, what are you doing?!

196
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,755
Don't tell me... it escaped outside...

197
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,757
You need to find it no matter what!

198
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,595
It's incomparable to any bird or beast
around there!

199
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,306


200
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,935
Hey, explain what happened.

201
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,979
You know something, don't you?

202
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,565
Did you do something again?

203
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,900
Hey, what's with the ruckus?

204
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,527
Ah, Vannie.

205
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,653
What happened?

206
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,197
-Gibbs collapsed, apparently.
-Eh?

207
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,325
Eh? It's Takita.

208
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,494
A small dragon?
And you say it ran inside the ship?

209
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,957
Um... it stopped on the deck's handrail...

210
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,335
And when I noticed, it had jumped inside...

211
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,086
And you let it go?

212
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,172
Why didn't you tell us immediately?

213
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,341
Because everyone was so tired...

214
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,802
And I thought "I can deal with this myself!"

215
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,262


216
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,765
And you say it's venomous?

217
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,184
I've never heard of a dragon like that.

218
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,979
I bet you wanted to catch it alone and
get a good chunk of money, right?

219
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:50,274
I may or may not...

220
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,820
Takita, was it about this size?

221
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,906
Eh? Ah, no...

222
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,159
About this... I think.

223
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,996
Really!

224
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,083
I've never seen a dragon this small!

225
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,042


226
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,669
How about we split in groups and catch it?

227
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,629
-Yeah!
-I agree!

228
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,755
I'll go tell the others!

229
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,048
-No...
-What?

230
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,841
It has either poison or a virus...

231
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:19,553
If we're not careful and end up
with more people infected, it'd be for nothing.

232
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,639
Wh-What should we do...

233
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,725
Until we solve it, 
we should gather all in one place

234
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,811
and select a few people to catch it.

235
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,522
Hm... it's as Jiro says.

236
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,358
Now, who should go...

237
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,317


238
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,527


239
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,903
Well, he's already in.

240
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,321
Ah! I'll go too!

241
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,198
Mika-san, wait!

242
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,033
Mika-san!!

243
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,035


244
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,830
I can't rest assured with just those two...

245
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,124
I'll go too.

246
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,876
If it's small we don't need strength.

247
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,837
And you have good eyes.

248
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,964
-Can we leave it to you?
-Sure.

249
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,009
So...

250
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,637
Why did it have to be like this?

251
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,475
The bridge is in the furthest end
of the ship...

252
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,018
Well, nothing we can do for now.

253
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,103
Ah!

254
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,521
Berko! That's unfair!

255
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:11,981


256
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,650
Ah? It's my lifeline!

257
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,820


258
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,281
How long it's been since we took her in?

259
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,741
About three months, I'd say.

260
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,578
Thing sure aren't boring since Takita arrived.

261
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:26,871
Right.

262
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:27,955


263
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,914


264
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:29,957


265
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:30,958


266
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,794
Are you ready?

267
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:34,795
Yeah.

268
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,466


269
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:42,386
Mika-san, do you smell any dragon?

270
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,973
The smell of dragon oil is adhered
to the ship and my body 

271
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,558
and that's the only thing I smell.

272
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:48,767


273
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,729
I suddenly want some fried food.

274
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,481


275
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,234


276
00:12:58,777 --> 00:12:59,904


277
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,865
It's not here either...

278
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,783
Are you sure you didn't mistake it, Takita?

279
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,327
It's real!

280
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,913
Gibbs-san was actually attacked!

281
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:13,083
Normally, dragons don't get close to ships
on their own.

282
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,043
Eh?

283
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,045
Then, why?

284
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,379


285
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,425

286
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,302


287
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,804
Was it attracted by something...?

288
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,764


289
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,141
That's probably this smell.

290
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,351
What?

291
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,310


292
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,064
Dragon oil...

293
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,238
It might be

294
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,950
that it gets closer to dragons
bigger than it relying on their smell


295
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,494
and parasitizes on them to live.

296
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:52,831
There's a lot of different dragons, huh...

297
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,002
The dragons we know are just a small part.

298
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,088

299
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,548
Takita!

300
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,633


301
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,720


302
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,514


303
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,974


304
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:10,975


305
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,061


306
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,939
You little...!

307
00:14:18,064 --> 00:14:18,857
Huh?

308
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,526
Ugh, this guy...!

309
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,610
Wait!

310
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,445


311
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,239
Here!

312
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:26,866


313
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,826
I'm telling you to wait!

314
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,661
Dammit!

315
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,162
You jerk!

316
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,290
-Oops...
-Wait!

317
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,417
-This little...
-Wait!

318
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:41,881


319
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,716
Got it!

320
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,384
Nice! Don't let it go!

321
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,553


322
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,721


323
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:49,889


324
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,141


325
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,767


326
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,811


327
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,524
If it bites, the poison will...!

328
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,526

329
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,446


330
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,865


331
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,368


332
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,746


333
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,583
You... you saved me...

334
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,669


335
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,254


336
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,675


337
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,595
So this is the one that bit Gibbs.

338
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,765
It's the first time I see such a small one.

339
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,851
Mika, are you really going to eat it?

340
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,228
We still don't know if it's venomous.

341
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,230
Don't come crying if you get poisoned.

342
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,399
It'll be fine as long as I don't eat the entrails.

343
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,526
Man...

344
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,905
Well, we were lucky we could solve it this time.

345
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,156
Yeah...

346
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,242
Newbie, don't go off on your own too much.

347
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,162
So cruel! You're a newcomer too, Jiro-san!

348
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,498
I'm a full-fledged crew member already.

349
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,709
Don't lump me with someone who joined
for no particular reason.

350
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:04,295
Oh? You've learned to talk big, eh, Jiro?

351
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,254


352
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,507
H-hey, Niko!


353
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:07,967
What the hell...

354
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:08,926
Um...

355
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,970
Are you really going to eat it?

356
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,721
What else is there to do?

357
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:17,226
Um... if we sold it in a town,
maybe we'd get some money...

358
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:21,563
We can't even extract oil from one so small,
so I don't think it will be worth too much.

359
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,023
Is that so...

360
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,943
Yoshi-san! I want to eat cutlet.

361
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,528
I can't make cutlet.

362
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,279
-We've run out of eggs.
-Eh?!

363
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,199
Then what should I do with my life?!


364
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,450
About what?

365
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,829
Cutlet isn't possible, but...

366
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:41,000
Yeah, it seems the skin is edible too.

367
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,710
How about we make it "demon style"?

368
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,087
Demon style?

369
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,799
Yeah. There are various theories about
the origin of its name, but

370
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:53,178
its appearence when it's finished
looks like a demon,


371
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,847
and apparently that's where 
the name comes from.

372
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,059
It doesn't feel like I'm cooking a dragon.

373
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:03,313
Even though it's small, 
it does have a proper heart.

374
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,899
Dragons fly on the sky thanks to this.

375
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,277
Ohh, with this...

376
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:12,156
After beheading it and emptying it out,
we slice it down its back.

377
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,951
Mika, do it, I'll prepare the marinade.

378
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,453
Sure.

379
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,749
How skillful... 

380
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,252
It's just small, but it's the same as
dissecting any other dragon.


381
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:30,257
Olive oil, lemon, salt and pepper,

382
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:34,011
and then, some spices I found in the galley,

383
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,180
and we leave it for 30 minutes.

384
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,015
This'll do.

385
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,142


386
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,269


387
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,564
On a frypan with a generous amount of oil,

388
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,567
we fry it with the skin side down.

389
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,153


390
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,780


391
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,031
Irresistible!

392
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,826
Press it down with a pot full of water,

393
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:04,291
and when it gets a good fried colour,
flip it and repeat the process.

394
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:08,879
Put the skin side down again, 
and when it's crispy fried...

395
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:10,881
It's done.

396
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,845


397
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,597


398
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,891
Okay! Time to eat...

399
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,226
It's hot!!

400
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,104


401
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,941


402
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,819


403
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,862
Hey, Mika! Don't tell me...

404
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,322


405
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,282
-Mika-san!
-It had poison after all...!

406
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,493


407
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,121


408
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,163
So good!!

409
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,832


410
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,626
Geez! Don't scare us like that.


411
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,836
Here.

412
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,046
We caught it ourselves.

413
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,798


414
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,304


415
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,224


416
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,851


417
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,311
This is delicious!

418
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,105
The outside is crispy and aromatic,

419
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,899
and the inside is so tender 
the umami just goes whaam!


420
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,067
Glad to hear.

421
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,861
Oh, let me see...

422
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,821
What the hell, stingy.

423
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,866
To begin with, you are too much
of a glutton always!


424
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,409
That's not true!


425
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:23,287
I really can't let myself 
be blinded by greed...

426
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,329


427
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,790
I've never been blinded by it so
I don't understand.

428
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,001
I can't really agree with that.

429
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,335
Ah, right!

430
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,713
Let's bring Gibbs-san half of this.


431
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,175
Mika, aren't you too blinded by greed
after all?!

432
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,302
Not at all.

433
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,595
Ah... don't take it!

434
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:41,889
No!

435
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:45,684
Wait! Stop!!

436
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,688
You still haven't found the dragon?!


437
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,857
That's a gift for the royal family!

438
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:56,403
It's a really rare ultra-small type
that can be appreciated even indoors!


439
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:02,367
It's worth 2 billions! 2 billions!
Do whatever you need to find it!

440
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,453


441
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,956
I don't think there's any poison, though...

442
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:12,085
Headache, chills, shivers, and fever.

443
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,254
These symptoms are just a cold.

444
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,422
Right.

445
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,882


446
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,384
His exhaustion might caught up to him.

447
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:24,348
Gibbs-san has been working day and night
with barely no relief.


448
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,307
Ah!

449
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,310
Gibbs works too hard!

450
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,563
Oh! So good.

451
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:32,648


452
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,774


453
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:37,945
And you too...

454
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:38,946
Eh?

455
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,906
Don't try too hard either, okay...

456
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:41,865
Ah, no!

457
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,910
I have a huge debt to pay off,
so I have to!


458
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,495
Ah, by the way,

459
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,039
why are you in the ship, Jiro-san?

460
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,749
Eh? Ah...

461
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,211


462
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,672
For a lot of reasons.

463
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,507


464
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,884
A lot, huh...

465
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,845
Right! I see, I see.

466
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,555
Well, yeah.

467
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,057
A lot.

468
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,811
But it's not good to keep secrets!

469
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,271
That's...

470
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,563


471
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,317
Well, isn't it good that it's lively?

472
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,819


473
