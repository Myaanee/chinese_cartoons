1
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:06,756
Seems that the engine is working well
after being repaired in Quon city.

2
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:08,174
Yeah.

3
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:11,219
It's doing its work in moving us
away from civilization.

4
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,638
Where are my dear bustling
sounds of the city...?

5
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:17,017
We are again immersed in the sounds
of rowdy men in a crowded space.

6
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,186
There you go again...
Wanna quit?
 
7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,980
As if.

8
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,274
It's not as if someone is waiting
for me on land anyway.

9
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,443
Ah... mmm, I see.

10
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,820


11
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,447
Oh, Jiro...

12
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,323
Oh... you seem pretty pumped-up!

13
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,035
Jiro, you got a haircut, huh?

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,787
It doesn't matter, right?
It was bothersome anyway.

15
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:40,373
It looks good on you!

16
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,375
Eh... thanks...

17
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,294


18
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,796


19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,384


20
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:54,262
Mika-san, there you go snitching
food again...

21
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,347
Gimme some too! Gimme!

22
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,016


23
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,435
What are you looking at?

24
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,853


25
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,897
The smell of the wind has changed.

26
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,398
The smell?

27
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:06,733
Yeah.

28
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:10,070
We're gonna catch the westerly winds
and look for dragon shadows.

29
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,199
Well... from here on out
this is uncharted territory for us as well.

30
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,077
Eh... could it mean...
danger?

31
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,287
Has it been a single moment aboard
when we're not exposed to danger?

32
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,246


33
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,457


34
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:23,875
You have a point.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,295
Also, you boarded in the best
possible moment, Takita.

36
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,546
Eh... eh?!

37
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:32,300
From this moment on, this ship 
will proceed, as planned,

38
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,761
to aim for "the dragon corridor".

39
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,472
The possibilities to encounter 
a pod are next to zero...

40
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,557
And, in the case we do, 
it'll be a difficult hunt,

41
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:43,144
but with our ears and eyes
I can assure you that we'll manage!

42
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,605
If it goes well, we'll make
a quick buck!

43
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,649
Our time has come.

44
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,151
How many years do you think
we've been preparing for this?

45
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,530
Indeed. And I beg of you to be
successful in this.

46
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:56,449
Don't forget the big 
investment that went into

47
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,659
making this hunt possible 
in the first place.

48
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,371
Once we are done with this,
this time we're gonna have our break for real!

49
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,666
Ah... what a beautiful sound...

50
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,043
Please, continue being in a 
good mood for me!

51
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,880
Ahh... draking at this high altitude...

52
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,133
I hope our hull lasts enough.

53
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:17,971
It's a duel to see who falls apart first:
the ship or us!

54
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,055


55
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,473
So scary...

56
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,768
"The dragon corridor"

57
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,565
The course of the Quin Zaza is now
directed to that special place.

58
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,651
They said that it's a dangerous zone

59
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,779
but, instead of cowering, everyone
seems to be in high spirits.

60
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:40,410
As for me... I couldn't 
really decide at the time.

61
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:47,584
♪〜

62
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:10,250
〜♪

63
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,381


64
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,092
Ah... Capella.

65
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,387
You may be short sighted 
but your skills are the real deal.

66
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,682
"Short sighted"? That's uncalled for!

67
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,517
We're counting on you!

68
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,977
Ah... Understood.

69
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,020


70
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:31,980


71
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,148


72
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,901
So creppy...

73
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,863
Bridge... don't fail us.

74
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,323


75
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,994
Why are we coursing between cliffs
even though we're an airship?

76
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,413
We are looking for updrafts.

77
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,623
When we find one, we'll go up
in no time.

78
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,877
Ah... are there dragon pods
above the cliffs?

79
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,797
Yes, above these thick clouds.

80
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:02,468
There should be a migrating pod,
a "ferry", that only goes through here
during this season.

81
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:06,014
"Should"? That doesn't sound 
very reassuring...

82
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,266
Ah... no, I mean...

83
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,477
Well, we don't have other option but to
believe in Crocco-san's calculations and intuition.

84
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,063
It's not as if we came here
with no plan at all.

85
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:17,900
Ah... at least we're in better hands
than relying on Gibbs' intuition.

86
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,694


87
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,778


88
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,156


89
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,616
Mmm? Mika-san?

90
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,578
I can't wait.

91
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,456
Ahh... that means we
are on the right trail.

92
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,415


93
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,000


94
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,209


95
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,669
We caught the updraft!

96
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:37,963
Any obstacles?

97
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,466
Okay, Capella, raise our bow!

98
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,842
Yes!

99
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,969
Engine room! Full speed ahead!

100
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,721
Ah! At long last!

101
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,390
Maximum output, here we go!

102
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,975


103
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,018


104
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,270
Geez... you're too into this!

105
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,022


106
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,982
Please, don't throw us off!
 
107
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,776


108
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,402


109
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,456


110
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,083


111
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,126


112
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,797
It's been a long time...
But we're finally back.

113
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,548
Ahh! Any dragons?

114
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,384
Mika-san?

115
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,553


116
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,475


117
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,602
Bridge! Right below us!

118
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,895
It's approaching!

119
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,021


120
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,023
Capella! Going full starboard!

121
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:39,982
Right away!

122
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,699


123
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,284


124
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,244


125
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,162


126
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,872
-Berko...
-Vadakin...

127
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,209


128
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,963
What the heck is that?

129
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,758


130
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,094
It's a pod...

131
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,763
It's a huge pod of little dragons!

132
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:14,183
Okay, we finally found it!

133
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,437
That's... they gathered and formed
a bubble?

134
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:21,107
It's like a huge dragon dango!

135
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,025
That is a "ferry".

136
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,945
So that's what we were looking for.

137
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,905
That means we nailed it!

138
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,033
It was about time that fortune 
started smiling on us!

139
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,702


140
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,539
We won't be able to use anchors
and bomb lances on this one...

141
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,249
Eh? Why?

142
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:42,044
What's with you? Think a little
about our prey's size.

143
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,546
Eh?

144
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:47,633
From what we can see, a single
dragon is about twice as tall as Gibbs.

145
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,219
If we shot an anchor or
bomb lances at one of those

146
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,345
what do you think would happen?

147
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,931
Ah! They would be torn to pieces!

148
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,099
Right?

149
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,392


150
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,394
Don't use me in your explanations!

151
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:03,065
You know, those little ones are great
because you can eat the meat on the bone.

152
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,693
Sinking your teeth directly 
into the meat...

153
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,320
Their tails would go great in a soup too...

154
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,613


155
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,281


156
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,034
It's been a long time since
we used that.

157
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,251


158
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,381
Amazing...

159
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,676


160
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,347
There we go! It's pulling!

161
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,140
If we tighten the rope so much,
we'll end up losing the prey!

162
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,601
Let the rope run till it weakens!

163
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,062
Argh, it burns!

164
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,105
I can't hold it with this friction...

165
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,024
Takita! Pour water on the rope!

166
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:45,983
Yes!

167
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,319
Only 20 meters of rope left!

168
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,988
Right! Pull!

169
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,494


170
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,247
Mika, pull it toward us.

171
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,331
We'll shot a second harpoon at it.

172
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,167


173
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:06,671


174
00:09:07,855 --> 00:09:08,256
Takita!

175
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,341
-Use the spear at your feet!
-Yes!

176
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,468


177
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,514


178
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,266


179
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,392
Takita...!

180
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,352


181
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:22,728


182
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,233


183
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,571
Hey... you're kidding...

184
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,657
She... she fell...?

185
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,118
Move!

186
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,328
Bridge! Takita has fallen!

187
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,454
Drop our course inmediately!

188
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,956


189
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,584


190
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:47,420
That girl...

191
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,505
She was clinging on to the dragon, 
wasn't she?

192
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,634
She is gonna be okay, I think.

193
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,273


194
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,527


195
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:13,904


196
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,657


197
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,953


198
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,832
Am I alive?

199
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,376


200
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,546


201
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,631


202
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,257


203
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,635


204
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:38,638


205
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,973


206
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,186


207
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,564
Ah... almost forgot...

208
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:52,443
The ointment Nanami-san
gave me.

209
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,196


210
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:00,701


211
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,704
I wonder what is this place...

212
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,166


213
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,002
I need to do my best for the ship
to find me.

214
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,840
But... what should I do?

215
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,927
Ah... that's it.

216
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,096


217
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,724


218
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,103


219
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,271


220
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,398
So hot!

221
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,983
Ah... I really did it!

222
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,111


223
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:40,199
I'm so glad I learned how
to start a fire properly.

224
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,035
I've gotta thank Jiro-san.

225
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,205


226
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,624
With just this, there's not
going to be enough smoke.

227
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,876
I need to build up the flame more.

228
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,670


229
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,923


230
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,174


231
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,134


232
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,468


233
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,220
It's no use.

234
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,097


235
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,435


236
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,394


237
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:14,817


238
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:20,739


239
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,367


240
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,870


241
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,082


242
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:33,586


243
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,505


244
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,718


245
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,512
Ah... it's suffering.

246
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,599


247
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,892


248
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,106


249
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:00,988


250
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,621


251
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,459


252
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,169


253
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,254


254
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,048


255
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,468


256
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,429


257
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,518


258
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:31,769


259
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:35,981


260
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,695


261
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,322


262
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:49,286


263
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,623


264
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,504


265
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:00,965


266
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,883


267
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,885


268
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:11,892
Return peacefully to the clouds 
and grant us good winds.

269
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,313
I'm sorry I couldn't 
hunt you well...

270
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,274
Forgive me.

271
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,402


272
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,530


273
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,163


274
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,957


275
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:38,919


276
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:42,923


277
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,633
Where did you come from?

278
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,970
Could it be...?

279
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,722


280
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,140


281
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,435
-Hey, Takita!!
-Takitaaa!!

282
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,270
-Takita!!
-Takitaaa!!

283
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,897
You... you can't be for real...

284
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,607
Answer us, damn it!!

285
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,358
Takita has fallen...

286
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,693
Tsk...

287
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,821
We can't land the ship in this
treacherous place.

288
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,449
Takita... shit...

289
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,409
She was such a good girl...

290
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:13,162
Don't say such ominous things!
We don't know anything yet for sure!

291
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,121


292
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,873


293
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,541
Ah! Jiro!

294
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,168
It'll be faster if I look
for her in this.

295
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,461


296
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,087
Mika!

297
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,965
I'll be watching behind you,
let's go.

298
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,593


299
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,094

300
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,638


301
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,597


302
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,058


303
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,935


304
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,853
Damn it!

305
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,316
Don't look at me with those eyes.

306
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:47,529
I need to take its entrails out
and cool down its meat.

307
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:48,948


308
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,117
If I don't, all of it will go to waste.

309
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,285


310
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:57,498
Please, go away, anywhere but here.

311
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:58,999


312
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,000


313
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,336


314
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,298
I can't dissect it well enough
with this.

315
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,800


316
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:09,969


317
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,223


318
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,474


319
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,187


320
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:26,944
I... can't do anything about this...

321
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:31,323
I'm a draker after all.

322
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,494


323
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:37,830


324
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,999
Are you worried about me?

325
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,792


326
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:49,341
And now, of all times...
is when my body starts to tremble?

327
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,551


328
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,928


329
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,972
Let me rest for a moment.

330
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,307


331
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,060


332
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:01,812


333
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,732
I dozed off.

334
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,901
Oh? Where's the little one?

335
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,987


336
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,242
Heey!

337
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,536


338
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,079


339
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,417
Where are you?!

340
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,627


341
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,921
Hey!

342
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:28,964


343
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,799


344
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,217


345
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:36,597
Geez... Don't wander off on your own!

346
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,806


347
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,851
I knew that the presence I sensed
wasn't a wild goat.

348
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:44,813
That floaty little thing, 
is that a dragon?

349
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:45,898


350
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,192
Ah! Wh- who are you?!

351
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,195
That's my line!

352
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,073
You entered someone else's territory
without even saying hello!

353
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,157
Mmm?

354
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,242
Eh??

355
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,245
It's the first time I see
a dragon alive so close!

356
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,538
Is this a cub?

357
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,416
- I'm Ascella, a matagi hunter.
-Eh?

358
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,335
These are my hunting grounds.

359
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,463
Ah... so you were a woman!

360
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,298
You should be able to tell
from my voice.

361
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,257


362
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,342


363
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,301


364
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,179
Ah, um...

365
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:21,850
I fell from a draking vessel
with an injured dragon...

366
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,018
Wait a second.

367
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,771
You fell from the sky
and survived?!

368
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:29,024
Wow! What a disaster you went through!

369
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:34,154
Ah... so that means you're
one of those drakers.

370
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,155


371
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,825
Ah... do you have a knife?!

372
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,702
Eh? Of course, I'm a matagi hunter.

373
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,206


374
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,167


375
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:51,296
I tasted dragon meat once before,
but dissecting it is a first for me!

376
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,216
Ah... this one is rather a small one.

377
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:58,387
We call everything a dragon, but
their types and sizes are very different...

378
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:02,224
How come it can fly without wings?

379
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,642
The dragons...

380
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,978


381
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,646
Fly with this.

382
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:08,605
"Dragon heart"

383
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,482
Even if they have different shapes...

384
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,777
All dragons have a heart like this one.

385
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,406
Ehh? Just with this?

386
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,075
It doesn't look very tasty...

387
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,577


388
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:25,789
Now that you mention it, the heart is so
hard that it's not edible.

389
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,292


390
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,503
Eh? Hey, are you okay?

391
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,505


392
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,715
Eh! Wai-!

393
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,175


394
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,969
You're burning up!

395
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,432


396
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,185
Mika, we don't have much fuel left.

397
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,936
We'll have to go back to the ship soon.

398
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:49,479
Yeah.

399
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,526
Jiro!

400
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,905
It's no good, the valley is so
much more complicated than I thought...

401
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,198
Once we refuel, we're setting out again!

402
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,324
-No way!
-Eh?

403
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,535
I won't allow that! The sun's setting soon.

404
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,537
You'll set out in this first
thing tomorrow morning.

405
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:08,582
Gibbs! You know that I can see well 
in the dark! Let me try once more!

406
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,584
Do you think I can allow that
and lose you too?

407
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,543


408
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:12,878


409
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,215
Ah... the sun is setting.

410
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:20,052
If we continue like this and lose
our field of vision, the ship will be in trouble too.

411
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,970
What should we do...?

412
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,597


413
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,976
Deputy captain, raise our course 
above the cliffs

414
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,228
and then...

415
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:35,150
Following the protocol, we'll declare the next
48 hours as the search period.

416
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,235
Is that good?

417
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,277
Mmm?

418
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,446
Yeah...

419
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,573


420
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,329
This place has a very complicated terrain.

421
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,123
Don't lower our course too much.

422
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,044
Continue the sailing in zigzag
at a low speed.

423
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,505
Crocco-san,

424
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,966
fires are not allowed at the bridge...

425
00:20:59,091 --> 00:20:59,925


426
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,344


427
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,514
Nevermind...

428
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,022


429
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:16,942


430
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:27,035
