1
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:07,465
Wow!
There's a city inside the crater!

2
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:09,092
That's the city of Quon.

3
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,178
A flourishing port city famous for being 
a base for drakers.

4
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,681
Since we have lot of repairing to do

5
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,975
we'll be stationed in this city for a while.

6
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,643
-Yahoo!
-Good grief...

7
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,146
Ahh...! Landing at last.

8
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:26,109
We had a lot of trouble with the 
air pirates and everything after all.

9
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,528
Jiro, this is your first time in
this city, right?

10
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:29,487
Yeah.

11
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,865
This city is a rendezvous point
for a lot of other draking vessels, isn't it?

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,366
So diligent as ever!

13
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,785
Our Jiro will be Jiro wherever
he goes, eh?

14
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,328
Wha- What's your problem?

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,414
It's just that you all are too easy-going.

16
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,083
Mika-san, there! Look, look!

17
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,042
Already lookin'.

18
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,463
Let's land quickly and begin dissecting.

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,173
You're no fun...

20
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:51,301
Mika-san, how can you be so dull?

21
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,429
Even after landing

22
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,973
There's plenty of work for
drakers to keep our hands busy.

23
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:02,645
But, certainly, going to a new place
sure gets your heart racing.

24
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:09,611
♪〜

25
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:32,152
〜♪

26
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,156
Hey! Let's begin!

27
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,032
Yeah!

28
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,536


29
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,121


30
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,831


31
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,543
Hey, Takita!

32
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,129
Come over here,
let's see you try your hands at dissecting.

33
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,088
Eh?

34
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,217
You can't stay "the newbie"
forever, you know.

35
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,094
Ye-... yes, sir!

36
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,099


37
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,227
First, try an horizontal cut
in the direction of the tail from there.

38
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,186
Understood!

39
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,105


40
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,815


41
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,567
Put more strength into it!

42
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,861
Don't be a scaredy cat!
Do it in one go! Now!

43
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,070
Ye-... yes!

44
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,156


45
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,867
Wow...

46
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,161


47
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,997
Okay... here goes!

48
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,416


49
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,335


50
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,837
Drive your blade between the meat and the
skin to cut it away.

51
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,505
So tough...

52
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,465
A little more! Go!

53
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,092


54
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:45,350
Okay, Takita.
That was pretty good for your first time.

55
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,559
Let's go for the red meat now.

56
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,269
Ye- yes, sir!

57
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:49,938


58
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,190


59
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,234
At long last!

60
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,277
We're done with all the dissecting
and deliveries!

61
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,781
Finished the clean up too!

62
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,449
Let's eat something tasty

63
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,243
and hit the nearest tavern!

64
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,078
Yeah!

65
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,663
Jiro...

66
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,706
You're coming with us!

67
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,542


68
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:16,839
The sensation from the dissection is
still in my hands.

69
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,093


70
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,388


71
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,934
We've sure come a long way...

72
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,687
It's done, it's done!

73
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:31,938


74
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,564
What's with her?

75
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,068
If you take into account that she 
was still not used to living aboard...

76
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,113
Dealt with not only a storm
but air pirates shooting at her as well...

77
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,532
You'd be pretty overwhelmed
by all of that, don't you think?

78
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,369
That girl...
She doesn't let her show in her face...

79
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,246
But I'm pretty sure that she's been pretty tense.

80
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,249
And now that tension has gone off all at once.

81
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,376
Are you sure she's not just hungry?

82
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,544


83
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,548
It's during moments like this that 
newbies decide to leave the ship.

84
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,507
Eehh!

85
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:04,429


86
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,388
Mmm?

87
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,556
Here.

88
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,142
Eh?

89
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,898
So tasty!

90
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,442


91
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,819
You can tell it's different from
meat roasted in a normal skewer!

92
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,864
Yeah, this is roasted after being
marinated in wine.

93
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,366
I was hoping to have these marinate
overnight but oh well...

94
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:29,329
Oh, that's why I thought I smelled
something tasty!

95
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,539
The skewers are made from grapevine wood.

96
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,917
If you roast meat using these
some of its aroma ends within it.

97
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,004
Mika-san, aren't you going out
somewhere today?

98
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,505
I'll go once I'm done
eating these.

99
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,133
Just... wait a moment, please!

100
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,385
Mmm?

101
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:50,141


102
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,560


103
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,897
Why did you go all-out and changed
your clothes?

104
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,357
A young lady doesn't have the chance
to visit a city everyday!

105
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,736
If this isn't the moment to wear
my fanciest clothes, then, when is it?

106
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,491
How about this, young man?

107
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,076
-Wahh!
-Don't need any.

108
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:09,619


109
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:10,995
Please, come again!

110
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,789
I didn't know you smoked.

111
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,207


112
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,958
Grrrr!

113
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,336
Hey... I'm gonna leave you here.

114
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,671
Ugh... fine...

115
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,553
Mika-san...
Where are we going?

116
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,180
We'll arrive soon.

117
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,684
A tent?

118
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,687


119
00:06:37,813 --> 00:06:38,314
Oh my.

120
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,316
That smell...

121
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,778
I'm glad...
that you didn't kick the bucket yet.

122
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,029
Gramps Ura.

123
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:48,116
Ha... I'm also glad you didn't too,
Mika.

124
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,992
I didn't see you here
for a month or so.

125
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,329
Nope, it's been 2 or 3 years, gramps.

126
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,707
Oh my? Do you have a companion
with you today?

127
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,960
I wonder if it is a young lady.

128
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,754
Mister, your eyes...

129
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,673
Oh?

130
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,509
How did you know I was
a young lady?

131
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,845
I can tell by the smell.

132
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,097
See? Spot on!

133
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,807
You're too innocent.

134
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,476
What's with this old pervert?

135
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,811
The Thousand Heads Hunter.

136
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:22,525
He is the chief of the clan 
that passes down their wisdom
on how to hunt dragons and dissect them.

137
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:26,154
But now I'm a simple senile
old fool, as you can see.

138
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:29,031
Besides that, he always takes
care of these.

139
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,158
What are those?

140
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,786
They're dragon pelts.
From the dragons we hunted.

141
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:37,957
Ohh... it is pretty well tanned.

142
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,667
What will be they used for?

143
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,461
To make one of these.

144
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,337
This tent...?

145
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,507
It is an ancient tradition...

146
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:51,888
We sew the pelts of the dragons we dissected
for the new generations to inherit.

147
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:55,933
Each pattern is different and all of them 
share the same meaning: a dragon hunted.

148
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:56,893
Eh?

149
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,270
This is the first dragon I hunted.

150
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,438
Eh?

151
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,732
E-... eh?

152
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,817
Which... means that...

153
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,404
All of these patterns 
represent dragons?

154
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,698


155
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,534


156
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:14,952


157
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,079


158
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,582
Here... it is starting to tear...

159
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,044
That one was from 3 generations
before Gramps Ura.

160
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:27,632
I'm... I'm touching an ancient dragon...

161
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:32,929
That was a dragon hunted by
a famous dissection expert named Ino.

162
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:37,225
This one was so big that they
had to call people from the neighbouring town.

163
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,769
And even after that,
it took seven whole days to dissect.

164
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,729
Wow...

165
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,732
But how do you know about all
of them, Mika-san?

166
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,984
Gramps Ura told me all the stories
and they got stuck in my head.

167
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:52,073
Mika used to sit there in front of
that wall without moving for days.

168
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,201
I think I can understand why he did that.

169
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,537
Since we have this pelt
from our most recent dissection...

170
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,829
Please, tan it well.


171
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,124
That one! That was from the very
first dragon I dissected!

172
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,835
Will it form part of this
wall too?

173
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,505
Umm... I see, I see...

174
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,509
In that case,
I think it deserves a very special spot.

175
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,136
Come here, Nanami!

176
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,271
The pelt teaches you the way
its pattern is gonna be.

177
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,939
Ohhh...

178
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:28,276
Its colour, feel, scales and hair...

179
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,152
Its irregularities and scars...

180
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,406
You can use all that to form
an expression of the pattern by instinct.

181
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,783
I see...

182
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,036
-Wanna try?
-Ah!

183
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,162
Of course!

184
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,541
Insert the needle and sew
both sides with the thread while pulling it.

185
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,877
Be careful the needle doesn't get
stuck with the thread.

186
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,132
"Dragon's skin tapestry"
It's... It's done!

187
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,802
The stitching is a bit rough
and it is a little twisted but...

188
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,262
I really like it.

189
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,680


190
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,057


191
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,685
I'm moved!

192
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,354
Ah... What's that?

193
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,148
That Vanabelle...

194
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,567
She was just hungry
as I thought!

195
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,526
Yes, that's it.

196
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,987
Wahh... what a beautiful colour.

197
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,406


198
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,991
How does it look?

199
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,702
Good old Dag is checking
it right now.

200
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:24,081
The structure and joints seem fine
so it seems we only need to replace the plating.

201
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,417
That's the silver lining, huh?

202
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,752
Although...

203
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,170
The gains we got this time

204
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,465
have almost vanished after
the necessary expenses and repair costs.

205
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,258
My head hurts so bad...

206
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,217


207
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,469
Where are all the others?

208
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,096
Everyone disappeared into
the city quite a while ago.

209
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,806


210
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:43,392
Damn, what a bunch of slackers.

211
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:44,352


212
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,438
Well, well, don't you prefer it this
way instead?

213
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:50,858
Yeah, we don't have our noisy Takita
around after all.

214
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,276


215
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,569
That's without question.

216
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,821
Sometimes it is nice to have a drink
between only us grown-ups.

217
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,907
Oh, you in?

218
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,575
I have something special for this ocassion!

219
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,494


220
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,621


221
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,377
Wow, look at that, amazing...

222
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,213
They got a huge one.

223
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,257
Ah... a vessel from the guild?

224
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,177
You can feel the difference in funds
in your bones.

225
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,519
Ah... I wish our ship was as big as
that one...

226
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,478
Yeah...

227
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,562


228
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,024
The value of a ship isn't 
measured by its size!

229
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,067
Ouch...

230
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,612
I'm going back to the captain's cabin!

231
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,699
You both know that you can't badmouth
our Quin Zaza in front of him.

232
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,785


233
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,122
If I could, I'd like to dock the Zaza

234
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,166
and overhaul its engine and stuff, you know?

235
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:53,337
The frontal aileron tends to give me problems
lately too...

236
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,506
I wonder if its chain has become loose.

237
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,883
I'd like to check the steering system
thoroughly to...

238
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,469
Ah... why this again...

239
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,097
We finally got some time off and
we can't stop talking about work.

240
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:08,936
With our lifestyle, there's not many
interesting things to talk about...

241
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,814
Vannie... how about you?

242
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,399
Eh? How about what?

243
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,568
"What?", don't play dumb!

244
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,779
Being as popular as you are,
you're sure to have plenty of partners to choose from!

245
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,198
Umm... not particularly.

246
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,868
Seems like she's not really interested in this...

247
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,328
To the point it's actually endearing.

248
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,788
Excuse me...

249
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,833
This round is a treat from the clients
over there...

250
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:31,876
Mmm?

251
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,586


252
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,672
Ahhh... not my type at all...

253
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,215
They seem like trouble...

254
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,176
We'd rather not, thanks.

255
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,260


256
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,595
Ahh...

257
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,972
Huh...? What the fuck's your problem?!

258
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,765
Our drinks are as good as any other!

259
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:47,725
Yeah, that's it!

260
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,519
I don't drink anything I haven't paid 
for myself.

261
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:53,147
Huh... we have an stuck-up lady right here.

262
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,399
Annoying men aren't precisely
popular anywhere, you know?

263
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,735
But I like my women feisty like you.

264
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,112
They're at it again...

265
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:04,325
Wait, wait, don't make a man
lose face like that.

266
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,618


267
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,786
If you want to have a drinking contest
I wouldn't mind to oblige.

268
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:08,746
Mmm?

269
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,166
About the loser's penalty,
let's see...

270
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:16,003
How about paying for all the rounds
of everyone present in this lovely tavern?

271
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,215


272
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,759
Tsk...

273
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,761
Seems like you have the guts, eh?

274
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,429
We accept the challenge!

275
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,680
-Ahhh...
-That's our girl!

276
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:30,059
Vannie-san...
Will you be ok after saying that?

277
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,186
Phew! I'm falling for you!

278
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,646

 
279
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,194


280
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,783
Eh...? You are, like,
pretty amazing.

281
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,535
You're noticing that now?

282
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,577
Yeah!

283
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,454
Say, why are you working in this kind
of place?

284
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,665
-Hey! Come over here!
-Right away!

285
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,418


286
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,587
What is that long face for, eh?

287
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,547
Niko...

288
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,926
If you find any girl to your liking
don't be shy and invite her to a room!

289
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,554
Ah... nah, I'm good.

290
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,847
I'm just here because you guys dragged me.

291
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,307
Besides that...

292
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:13,310
I can see from a mile away that if I did
anything I'd end up becoming the butt of the joke.

293
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:17,231
You know I think of you as you
were my cute little brother...

294
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,860
But man, rubble like us...

295
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:25,239
You can't say when we will 
have another chance like this.

296
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,032


297
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:30,119
Let go of me, brute!

298
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,122
Please, put her down! That girl
isn't taking any customers yet!

299
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,583
No way, I want her and her alone.

300
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:40,004
Wait, you! What are you misunderstanding?
Let me go!

301
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,590
She will end up taking customers
sooner or later.

302
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,718
If that day is today, it doesn't 
matter, right?

303
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,096
That uniform... he is a member
of a ship crew too.

304
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,891
Jiro, leave them alone.
It's better if we don't put ourselves in troubl-

305
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:52,933
Hey, you! Put her down!

306
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,184
-Oh...
-Can't you see that she dislikes it?

307
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,021
You... are you a draker?

308
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,608
Yeah. We just hunted a huge
dragon too.

309
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,236
As a draker, too, I'd rather not
see something that does our name dirty.

310
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:07,114
But this place is precisely where
things get pretty dirty, boy.

311
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,242
Can't you put me down before your
little conversation?

312
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,201


313
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,828


314
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,622
Ow...

315
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,166
-Quick, go upstairs and...
-Eh?!

316
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,375


317
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,920
This little pipsqueak says he's a draker!

318
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,963


319
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,051
It's because of people like you that
drakers get scorned everywhere!

320
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,344
What?

321
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,762


322
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,305


323
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,264


324
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,099

325
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,225
-Mmm?
-Ah?

326
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,436
Ow...

327
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,898
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
You see, I can't find my footing sometimes...

328
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:41,857
Niko!

329
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:46,278
Would you be so kind
as to not pick on my little brother?

330
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,237
Huh??

331
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,781
Are you picking a fight with us?

332
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,992
What seems to be the problem?
Can't take it easy like this.

333
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,370
If you are going to fight,
do it outside!

334
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,788
They're gonna fight, yeah!

335
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:56,872


336
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,082


337
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,378
You see, I can't control
my hands too sometimes...

338
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,131
Heh, how amusing.

339
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,091


340
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,467


341
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,595


342
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,099
Ah... what the hell were they thinking?

343
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,767
You sure you don't need to go?

344
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,687
I'll pass.
I'm a firm pacifist.

345
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,646


346
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,605
Stop that...

347
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,691
Ah... This has become a whole mess...

348
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,652
Ah... my precious bar...

349
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,570
-Now's our chance!
-Oh? Hey!

350
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:29,947
Wait!

351
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,832
This lady is amazing!

352
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,375


353
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,002
I... I give up.

354
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,254
That's our Vannie!

355
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,423
She drank everything without
breaking a sweat!

356
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,472
The stalls are already in place!

357
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,476
The day after tomorrow,
there's going to be an annual festival.

358
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,687
You! What's your name?

359
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,646
I'm Jiro.

360
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,816
My name's Katja.
Thank you for earlier.

361
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,610
All that running made me hungry!

362
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:13,635
"Dragon meat hand-rolled Laghman"

363
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:17,286
I like mine with plenty of
smashed peanuts!

364
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,329
Boss, can we eat this over there?

365
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:20,789
Yeah, as long as you return the plate.

366
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:21,957
Okay!

367
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,710


368
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,837


369
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,756
What's this? It's delicious!

370
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,800
You were right, the more peanuts,
the better!

371
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,636
Right? Enjoy it thoroughly.

372
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,931
I say that, but you were the
one who paid for it.

373
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:43,854
Eh... so you guys travel around the
world searching for dragons...

374
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,397


375
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,317
Maybe this meat is from one of the
dragons you caught, eh, Jiro?

376
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,693


377
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,530


378
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,909
Hey! Tell me stories about the sky!

379
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,494


380
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,415
My father was a draker as well...

381
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,376
And when I was a kid, he used to
tell me a lot of stories.

382
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,419
I see, I see!

383
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:11,423
So, in our ship there's this guy
named Mika who is amazing!

384
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:15,719
But, when I'm not there to look after
him, he always end up doing something reckless!

385
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,262


386
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,306
That sounds crazy!

387
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,266
Oh, wait a moment...

388
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,021
-Here!
-Thank you!

389
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:30,442
It sounds nice...
Waking up and being over the clouds...

390
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,362
Well, life in the sky isn't so easy...

391
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:38,200
I've never set a foot out of this
city in all my life.

392
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,537
Since they sold me when I was little
I've been here, always.

393
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,373
Isn't it ridiculous?

394
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:48,252
Even though we're in a port city,
I've never been to anywhere else.

395
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,302
It's time I go back...

396
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,555
Thanks for accompanying me.

397
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,851
I only ever saw the festival 
from my window.

398
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,020
It was pretty fun to have
a little taste of it!

399
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,105
Oh...

400
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,065
Well, see you later!

401
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,693
Listen!

402
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,653
The day after tomorrow...

403
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,947
Let's come here together!

404
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,167
Bye-bye.

405
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,009


406
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,553
Guys, I'm beyond tired of this bullshit!

407
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,140
Each and every one of you, what the
fuck were you thinking, bunch of brainless monkeys?

408
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,601
I hope the brainless monkeys reflect
on what they did.

409
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,894
Soraya...

410
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,771
You were there and did nothing to stop them,
you're just as guilty!

411
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,773
Eh! No way in hell!

412
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,942
Hey, Jiro! Where have you been?

413
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,737
To begin with, this was all because you did...

414
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,696
Yeah...

415
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:01,241
Ah? What's his problem?

416
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,661
What happened, guys?
You look totally wrecked.

417
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,997
These are our proud medals as men.

418
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,124
Woah... it looks painful.

419
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,003


420
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,714
Is this seat free?

421
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,091
Ah... Vannie...

422
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,886
You've been out heavy drinking again, right?

423
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,304
Just a tiny bit.

424
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,431
And that's why I need to cool off.

425
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,894
-Vannie...
-Yeah?

426
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,855
Listen, I...

427
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:33,982
Nevermind...

428
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,235


429
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,614


430
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,449


431
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:44,868
That ship is...!

432
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:01,843


433
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,846
How the hell is that dragon moving
in the dissection dock?!

434
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:17,150


435
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:19,987
