1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:03,670
It's only after arriving to a big city,

2
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:07,465
that drakers can finally stretch
their legs.

3
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:11,094
Just for a brief moment...

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,849
That's precisely why,
it becomes an irreplaceable memory.

5
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,354


6
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:24,983
I'm sorry to impose on you 
for dinner as well...

7
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:28,278
Mika-san, we have to get going.

8
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,031


9
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,657
Heeey.

10
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:33,825


11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,035
Geez...

12
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:39,205
I'm sorry again, he always sleeps
as soon as he drinks...

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,665
He's always so sloppy.

14
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,500


15
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,961
I see he hasn't changed.

16
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,714
That's what happens when he drinks
with Gramps Ura.

17
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,382
He's stupidly strong with alcohol.

18
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:50,341


19
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,968
Nanami-san...

20
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,512
Is the Quin Zaza leaving soon?

21
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,932
There's still repairs to do so 
I think we'll stay for a while.

22
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,267
I can't eat anymore...

23
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,604
Then you'll be able to see the 
festival the day after tomorrow.

24
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,563
Isn't that great?

25
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,732
Eh, there's a festival?!

26
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,650


27
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,569
Did something happen?

28
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:11,529


29
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,031
What's going on?

30
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,949
Hey, that... it's smoke!

31
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,284
What?

32
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,369
Is that... a fire?

33
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,788
That way's the port.

34
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:20,914
Ah, Mika-san!

35
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,123


36
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,333


37
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,338
-Takita, let's go.
-Ah, yes!

38
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,799


39
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,177
Shit, what's going on?!

40
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,804
Hey, this is bad...

41
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,532
It's coming this way!

42
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,649


43
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:58,868


44
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:05,583
♪〜

45
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:28,207
〜♪

46
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,420


47
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,507
Tsk... and we just got here today.

48
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,134
Ah, Crocco-san!

49
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,177
Where are the others?

50
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,721
There was a call for rescue,
they're on their way.

51
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:42,805
What do we do with the Zaza?

52
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,098
Uh...

53
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,100
Mayne, you go wake up the old man Dag


54
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,310
and warm up the engine.

55
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,269
Yes.

56
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,854
Capella, go to the bridge.

57
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,689
Make it so we can move it at any given time.

58
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:52,649
Okay!

59
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:57,570
Guess we gotta save the vacation for later.

60
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,281


61
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,616
Well...

62
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,412


63
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,087
Look what have you done!

64
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,213
It's a huge loss!

65
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,464
E... evacuate!

66
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,383
Hurry up! Run away!

67
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,385
Hey, there's someone hurt!

68
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,429
Shit, what way do we run to?!

69
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,275
Hey! What's going on?

70
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,818
Isn't that your ship?

71
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,112
Y-you guys...

72
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,614


73
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,117
Here, I'll lend you a hand. 
Hang in there.

74
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,035
Ugh... thanks...

75
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,955
You didn't finish it off?

76
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,707
That's impossible.

77
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,960
We've taken down dragons that big
countless times before!

78
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,005
It suddenly started moving when 
we got back to the ship!

79
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,423
What?

80
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,925
I guess there are dragons out there

81
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,469
much tougher than we think.

82
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,931


83
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,559
We didn't use enough for it to be lethal?

84
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,729
No way... we used a whole lot of poison.

85
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:13,688
Poison?

86
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,153
In our ship we shoot poison 
to capture dragons.

87
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,073
For that dragon too, we let it
fall to the ground and towed it after that.

88
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,033


89
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,076
That's way too violent!

90
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,036
The hell I care.

91
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:28,995


92
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,623
Well, don't mind the details now,
helping people comes first.

93
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,501
Hurry up, before the dragon 
starts rampaging!

94
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:37,837
Yeah!

95
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,214


96
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,340


97
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,514
Vannie! Let me.

98
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,767


99
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,186


100
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,313

101
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,398


102
00:05:58,983 --> 00:05:59,817


103
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,194


104
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,237
Oh, man...

105
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:07,241
He would've been happier if he
kicked the bucket just like that...

106
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,994
When my time comes please
do it to me, Vannie.

107
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,789
Hey! We need help over here too!

108
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,165
Coming!

109
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,209
Ready, and...

110
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,919
Go!

111
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,879


112
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:22,882
Hang in there!

113
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,134


114
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,094


115
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:31,390


116
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,684


117
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,485
Why is there a dragon inside the city...?

118
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,447
Ah... and it's so...

119
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:47,698
It's...

120
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,534
Huge!

121
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:54,455


122
00:06:58,918 --> 00:06:59,836


123
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,343
It's gonna charge into the city!

124
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,282
Run, Takita!

125
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,278


126
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,698


127
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,116


128
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,368
Ah, Mika-san!

129
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,662


130
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:37,790


131
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,794
It's so angry...

132
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,212
No...

133
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,882
Ah! It's scared?

134
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,388
Everyone, get out of here!

135
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,514
City guards!

136
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:54,515
Eh?

137
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,350
Don't let it get any closer
to the town areas!

138
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,768
Evacuate, quickly!

139
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:58,936
This thing...

140
00:07:59,061 --> 00:07:59,896


141
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,439
Idiot! Don't shoot at random!

142
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,398


143
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,610


144
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,570


145
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,781
G... good! Kill it!

146
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:11,991
Yes, sir!

147
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,536
It's working!

148
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,662
Keep shooting!

149
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,625
Stop!

150
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,794
What's that...?

151
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,380


152
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,270
Don't care, attack it!

153
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,064
What's it doing?

154
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,106


155
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,776
Run! Quick!

156
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,031


157
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,415


158
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,834


159
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,044
What's that?

160
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,797
The city is... on fire!

161
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,425


162
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,511


163
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,888
W-what was that?

164
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:16,847
I don't know.

165
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,641
What do you mean you don't know...

166
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,226

167
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,062
Mika! Takita!

168
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,564
So you were here.

169
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,649
Evacuate the citizens outside the port!

170
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:27,817
Gibbs-san!

171
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:28,776
You okay?

172
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,278
Yes, somehow.

173
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,737
We need to evacuate too, quickly.

174
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:32,697
Mika!

175
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,575
Yeah, it's the first time I see 
one like that.

176
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,326


177
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,132
Did something good happen?

178
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,174


179
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,052
Ah, no, not really...

180
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,972
You look like you got your heart stolen.

181
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,808
Did you find a good man?

182
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,437
It's not like that.

183
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,189
I hope you understand, though.

184
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,109
Whimsical dreams will be your demise.

185
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,237
Yes, I know.

186
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,365


187
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,325


188
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,746


189
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,039
Hey, girls!

190
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,207
We're evacuating, come!

191
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,793
And where are we supposed to evacuate to?

192
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,337
Outside the city!

193
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,755
What happened?

194
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,715
They said a dragon is on a rampage.

195
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,759
No matter if this place goes down,

196
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,011
it will be the same everywhere else.

197
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,973
We don't have anywhere to go to.

198
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,685


199
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,022
What are the drakers doing?

200
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,859
Apparently it's precisely their ship
that they can't use.

201
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:55,154
Good grief... 
and the mess they did today too...

202
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,115
Because of them, 
we can't do business in peace!

203
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,868
Anyway, I'll be going on ahead.

204
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,037
You take refuge soon too!

205
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,874


206
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,504
No festival for us, huh?

207
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:18,177
Ah... the merchant ships are all gone too.

208
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,513
We should get going as well!

209
00:11:21,238 --> 00:11:22,473
I'm back!

210
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,557


211
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:26,310
Takita! Where were you?

212
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:27,770


213
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,563


214
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,649
Come on, we're getting out of here.

215
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,609
Eh, no way...

216
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,278
Then what's going to happen
to the people of this city?

217
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,073
Ah... that's...

218
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:43,077
That dragon has stopped moving 
for now, but...

219
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,955
What are you going to do if we get
involved in its frenzy?

220
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,040
We're gonna end up like that big ship!

221
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,335
You saw that heat ray and blast, 
didn't you, Takita?

222
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,711
Yes...

223
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:57,675
First of all, we couldn't possibly
do anything with a dragon that huge...

224
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,926
But...

225
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,469
Gibbs-san!

226
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,097


227
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,016
Huh? Mika isn't with you?

228
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,017
Eh?

229
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,770
He was with us until a moment ago...

230
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,188


231
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,816
That jerk... what's he thinking?!

232
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,111
He can only be thinking about one thing.

233
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,530
What an idiot!

234
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,866
Jiro, I'm sorry but could you 
get Mika...

235
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:22,825


236
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,161
Jiro?

237
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,246


238
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,257
Gibbs.

239
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:33,169
Can't we take the townspeople on board
the Quin Zaza?

240
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,920

241
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,214
Take them on board for what?

242
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,758
Jiro, I undersand how you feel, but...

243
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,012
Ah, come on, we can't stay here 
wasting time, right?

244
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,268
I...

245
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,485


246
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,537


247
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,501
It can't fly anymore.

248
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,336
Gramps Ura.

249
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,423
They used poison, apparently.

250
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,426
Indeed. I can tell from the smell.

251
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,638
And to make it worse, 
it lost its sight.

252
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,807
That's why it's scared.

253
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,270
Mika, boy.

254
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:37,191
Do you know what's 
deeper than the sky?

255
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,734
It's people's...

256
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,612
That's fine and all, but

257
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,782
can we eat it?

258
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:45,908
What?

259
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:50,037
Gibbs! We can carry the people to
the neighbouring town.

260
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,331
We're about the only ship that's left here.

261
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,582
Then...!

262
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,251
Not realistic, I have to say.

263
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,335
Eh?

264
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,004
You say "the neighbouring town"
but it's still pretty far away.

265
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,716
How many round trips do you plan to do?

266
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,719
To begin with, this is 

267
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:09,723
a problem between that ship that brought
a half-dead dragon and this city.

268
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,892
We have nothing to do with this.

269
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:14,812
You're not being your usual self.

270
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:15,980


271
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,065
Heeey!

272
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,942
Ah, Mika!

273
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:20,901
What have you been-

274
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,319
Everyone, get ready!

275
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,488
We can eat that dragon!

276
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,119
Right! So happy!

277
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,537
Eh... Yes!

278
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,872
E-eh?

279
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,124
Ah... you're one of a kind...

280
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,502
We were just talking about 
getting out of here...

281
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,713
Eh, why?!

282
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:44,008
It was people's actions that hurt
the dragon to that extent.

283
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,759
Ah, grandpa!

284
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:50,514
Then, it should also be people's
actions that put an end to it.

285
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,766
Originally, humans and nature...

286
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,978
So, we can extract the poison 
from its meat

287
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,730
and eat it, right?

288
00:14:58,897 --> 00:14:59,857
Yes...

289
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,276
It depends on the type of poison, but

290
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,528
there is always a method.

291
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:05,946


292
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,241
He says we can eat that huge thing!
Hear it?

293
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,535
Don't "hear it?" us!

294
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,870
Eat it?

295
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,129
I... think it's fine if 
we capture it.

296
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,380
Huh?

297
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:24,715
Vannie-san!

298
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,051
Even if we had encountered

299
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,679
something that big in the sky, 
we wouldn't have been able to touch it.

300
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,140
But now, it's different.

301
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,100
It's a wounded dragon, 
which has fallen to land.

302
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,479
Like we said earlier, we're outsiders.

303
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,023
If we fail, 
no one will put the blame on us.

304
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,650
If it goes wrong, 
we can just run away.

305
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,234


306
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,613
If it goes well, the benefits
are for us.

307
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:52,368
Especially, for a poor ship like ours,
the only chance to catch something this big


308
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,786
is now. Never again.

309
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,204


310
00:15:56,371 --> 00:15:57,623
Vannie...

311
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,041


312
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:04,588
Hey, who are you calling a poor ship?

313
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,052

314
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,512
Gibbs.

315
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,430
Think of a way to catch that dragon.

316
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,641
Eh, for real?

317
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,727
Huh? Are we doing it, Crocco-san?

318
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,246
Now that's come to this,
what else we gotta do?

319
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:21,981


320
00:16:22,806 --> 00:16:24,274
Great! Leave it to me.

321
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,027
We might be poor but we have
experience and intuition going for us!

322
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,737


323
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:29,822


324
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,742
We'll teach the rest of the ship crews
a lesson or two!

325
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,078
One last big catch before our vacation!

326
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,914


327
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,047
Let's do this.

328
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,258
We're drakers!

329
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,307
I came to an agreement with 
the other ship's captain.

330
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,977
He's going to lend us some people.

331
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,395
Here's the memorandum.

332
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,564
Did he give you trouble?

333
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,858
The captain's a calm person.

334
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,693
The crew didn't seem satisfied though.

335
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,652


336
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,904
Who was the one who packed these?

337
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,656
Ah, that would be me.

338
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,033
This is wrong!

339
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:17,494
If you don't put the 
bullets and gunpowder in pairs, 
we can't use them right away!

340
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,454
'ight...

341
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:23,959
But man, we're just going to attack it
both from land and the air at the same time.

342
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,211
Can you call that a strategy?

343
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:29,590
Come on... sure that's not 
experience nor intuition.

344
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,633
Well, things will go however they go.

345
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,635
And if they go wrong, that'd be bad.

346
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,679
Ah... if that happens
say goodbye to the business.

347
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,431
As long as we are alive...

348
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,507
You three!

349
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,060
If you have time to talk, 
move your hands instead!

350
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,519
Takita!

351
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,772
You'll be the one loading the guns, okay?

352
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,273
Make sure to know what's in the cart!

353
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,067
-Yeees.
-Hey, Mika!

354
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,943
Ah? What.

355
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,862


356
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,073
Nothing!

357
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,701
We don't know when will the dragon
start rampaging again!

358
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,328
Everyone, hurry up!

359
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,166
Jiro-san is very enthusiastic today.

360
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,125


361
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,795
What the hell's with him?

362
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,755


363
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:10,881


364
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,885
I loaded the harpoon gun with
double the gunpowder.

365
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,597
It should do quite a lot of damage
if it explodes inside the dragon!

366
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:19,765
Wow, you splurged there.

367
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,017
I won't forgive you if you fail.

368
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,352


369
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,686
You take care of the ship!

370
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,021
Make it work, okay?

371
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,356
Leave it to me!

372
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,150
Gibbs! We're almost done preparing.

373
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,610
Let's go over the plan again...

374
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,569


375
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:33,737


376
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:34,696


377
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,292
What's that?

378
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,754
An autogyro! How rare!

379
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,464
The guys from the other ship?

380
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,636


381
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,141
Those guys... what do they intend to do?

382
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:03,475
Oh, no!

383
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,148
Good thing this didn't burn.

384
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,107
Right!

385
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,568
That's our prey, to begin with.

386
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,195
To think he accepted their proposal...

387
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,531
Our captain's not right in the head!

388
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,490
Yeah.

389
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:22,536
As if I could let them take
300 barrels of dragon oil from
under our noses!

390
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,499
We'll finish it off.

391
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,752


392
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,173


393
00:19:35,056 --> 00:19:35,791
Did it work?

394
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:38,135
Those jerks!

395
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,094
What have they done...

396
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,429


397
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,930
It's about to go wild...

398
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,557
It was all for nothing!

399
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,023


400
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,449


401
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,534


402
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,037


403
00:20:08,714 --> 00:20:10,000
No way!

404
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,921


405
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,550
That's dangerous!

406
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,178


407
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,390
Those idiots! They ran off on their own!

408
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,352
We're starting as soon as possible!
Tell those down there!

409
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,311

410
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,270


411
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,481
H-hey, Jiro!

412
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,608


413
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,365


414
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,368


415
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,795
I'm on a hurry, please make way!

416
00:20:58,966 --> 00:20:59,800


417
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:01,969
It's falling!

418
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:07,641
Oh, no...

419
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,060
This is bad! Really bad!

420
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,904
Katja!!
